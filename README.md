# SUL Media Transcription Tools

For now, this is a placeholder repo where we can ticket some things that don't yet have a natural home (and which may end up living in this repo after prototyping/implementation, e.g. a definition for the Docker container we run on cloud based GPU instances, supporting tools and docs, etc).
