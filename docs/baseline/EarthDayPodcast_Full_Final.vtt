00:16.840 --> 00:19.320
Good evening, everyone. You're listening

00:19.320 --> 00:23.240
to KCSU Stanford 90.1. Thank you so much

00:23.240 --> 00:24.940
for joining us for the Happy Birthday

00:24.940 --> 00:27.360
Earth Day 50th Anniversary Special

00:27.360 --> 00:29.260
featuring students from Ellen Fletcher

00:29.260 --> 00:31.100
Middle School in Palo Alto, California.

00:31.900 --> 00:34.600
I'm Lexi Nealon. And I'm Chris Escobedo.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.660
And we will be your hosts tonight for this

00:36.660 --> 00:38.380
Earth Day special. We're both

00:38.380 --> 00:40.460
undergraduates completing degrees in the

00:40.460 --> 00:42.100
Earth Systems program at Stanford

00:42.100 --> 00:44.240
University. For our senior capstone

00:44.240 --> 00:45.740
project, we wanted to work on something

00:45.740 --> 00:47.440
that would make a difference in the world,

00:47.560 --> 00:50.080
not just for us as students, but for the

00:50.080 --> 00:52.520
broader community as well, something that

00:52.520 --> 00:55.160
would last beyond our time at Stanford. We

00:55.160 --> 00:57.140
were especially interested in working with

00:57.140 --> 00:59.280
youth for this project because we see a

00:59.280 --> 01:01.500
tremendous need and desire to involve them

01:01.500 --> 01:04.320
in the environmental movement. In recent

01:04.320 --> 01:06.560
years, Gen Z has become increasingly

01:06.560 --> 01:09.360
interested in environmental activism, and

01:09.360 --> 01:11.060
the Washington Post actually estimates

01:11.060 --> 01:13.940
that 24% of current U.S. teenagers have

01:13.940 --> 01:16.400
participated in a school walkout, attended

01:16.400 --> 01:18.640
a protest, or written to a government

01:18.640 --> 01:20.460
representative about climate change.

01:20.460 --> 01:23.480
Because lots of environmental issues are

01:23.480 --> 01:26.100
complex and overwhelming, we were curious

01:26.100 --> 01:28.560
to hear how young people would talk about

01:28.560 --> 01:30.860
them in their own voices, what questions

01:30.860 --> 01:32.880
they might have, what concerns they'd

01:32.880 --> 01:35.060
have, and what they look forward to in the

01:35.060 --> 01:37.700
future. We were also so aware of the need

01:37.700 --> 01:39.960
for hope and optimism, especially right

01:39.960 --> 01:42.340
now during this pandemic, and it seemed

01:42.340 --> 01:44.840
that empowering youth to participate in

01:44.840 --> 01:47.220
these complex discussions could serve as a

01:47.220 --> 01:48.800
powerful motivator for environmental

01:48.800 --> 01:51.280
activism. activism. I've worked in radio

01:51.280 --> 01:54.100
at KCSU for almost four years, so I know

01:54.100 --> 01:56.460
that this is a great platform not only for

01:56.460 --> 01:58.560
participants to highlight their ideas, but

01:58.560 --> 02:00.540
also for them to build confidence, learn

02:00.540 --> 02:02.220
how to talk with people, and find their

02:02.220 --> 02:04.460
own voice. Putting all that together,

02:04.780 --> 02:06.180
Chris and I thought that a podcast

02:06.180 --> 02:07.480
highlighting middle schoolers'

02:07.520 --> 02:09.420
perspectives at an age when they are

02:09.420 --> 02:11.180
really coming into their own in terms of

02:11.180 --> 02:13.080
becoming active decision makers in their

02:13.080 --> 02:15.340
school and community would be a great way

02:15.340 --> 02:17.520
to celebrate Earth Day. Over the last

02:17.520 --> 02:19.840
three months, we've worked collaboratively

02:19.840 --> 02:21.500
with 13 Ellen Fletcher middle school

02:21.500 --> 02:23.720
students to prepare them to interview

02:23.720 --> 02:26.100
their chosen trusted adults and to be

02:26.100 --> 02:28.500
interviewed themselves. We hope that

02:28.500 --> 02:29.860
hearing from these students will make

02:29.860 --> 02:31.760
others excited about considering the youth

02:31.760 --> 02:33.980
voice, especially when making decisions

02:33.980 --> 02:36.700
that impact future generations. The

02:36.700 --> 02:38.480
remainder of this program follows the

02:38.480 --> 02:40.100
students as they interview family,

02:40.320 --> 02:42.660
friends, mentors, and teachers from their

02:42.660 --> 02:44.640
community who reflect on environmental

02:44.640 --> 02:46.480
changes they've noticed since the first

02:46.480 --> 02:49.980
Earth Day in 1970. Later on, the same

02:49.980 --> 02:51.800
students will discuss their perspectives

02:51.800 --> 02:53.640
on today's environmental challenges,

02:53.860 --> 02:56.560
particularly climate change, and offer

02:56.560 --> 02:58.620
their own inspiring visions for how we

02:58.620 --> 03:00.480
might achieve a more sustainable future.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.060
Before we get started though, we'd like to

03:04.060 --> 03:06.060
share a quick message with you about the

03:06.060 --> 03:08.820
temporary coronavirus-related closure of

03:08.820 --> 03:12.100
our campus arts museum. As part of

03:12.100 --> 03:14.880
Stanford's response to COVID-19, Cantor

03:14.880 --> 03:16.980
Arts Center has closed its galleries to

03:16.980 --> 03:18.940
the general public until at least May

03:18.940 --> 03:21.980
15th. In the interim, the museum is

03:21.980 --> 03:24.480
offering a digest of digital resources for

03:24.480 --> 03:26.500
visitors to explore through Museums at

03:26.500 --> 03:31.200
Home link. Visit museum.stanford.edu slash

03:31.200 --> 03:35.400
museums dash home. Cantor Arts is looking

03:35.400 --> 03:37.460
forward to reopening its doors once again

03:37.460 --> 03:40.940
as soon as possible. For more info, go to

03:40.940 --> 03:45.500
museums.stanford.edu. Thanks, Chris, for

03:45.500 --> 03:48.300
that important update. Now, as a reminder,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.840
each of our 13 students selected one adult

03:50.840 --> 03:53.120
participant, and the only criteria we

03:53.120 --> 03:55.040
required for their selection was that the

03:55.040 --> 03:56.480
adult had to be someone they would be

03:56.480 --> 03:58.200
comfortable interviewing and was at least

03:58.200 --> 04:00.400
50 years old, such that they were alive

04:00.400 --> 04:03.540
during the first Earth Day in 1970. Right,

04:03.660 --> 04:05.520
so let's go ahead and meet those adults

04:05.520 --> 04:06.400
that our students chose.

04:10.860 --> 04:14.340
I'm a mother of one fantastic daughter,

04:14.600 --> 04:18.140
and I'm an administrator at Stanford in

04:18.140 --> 04:20.800
the computer science department. I'm like

04:20.800 --> 04:23.460
technically a secretary, a nutrition

04:23.460 --> 04:25.880
expert, a housekeeper and fashion

04:25.880 --> 04:28.440
counselor for my husband and my two

04:28.440 --> 04:31.940
beautiful kids. And I was born in Mexico

04:31.940 --> 04:34.120
City. I'm the daughter of Spanish

04:34.120 --> 04:37.520
immigrants. I am a teacher, and I'm very

04:37.520 --> 04:40.820
proud to be one, even though I don't teach

04:40.820 --> 04:44.580
nowadays. I'm from Berkeley, California,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.700
and I, of course, am retired. I'm elderly.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.600
I volunteer at the food closet and have a

04:53.600 --> 04:58.120
great book club. I'm from Bulgaria, Sofia

04:58.120 --> 05:00.240
is the capital of Bulgaria. I was born

05:00.240 --> 05:04.160
during communism and then my husband won a

05:04.160 --> 05:06.640
green card from the lottery and we all

05:06.640 --> 05:11.120
became here. And we are in the USA since

05:11.120 --> 05:15.220
March of 1996. I live in Palo Alto,

05:15.320 --> 05:18.500
California. I run a company, I'm the CEO

05:18.500 --> 05:21.240
and co-founder of a tech company that has

05:21.240 --> 05:23.780
a software solution based on artificial

05:23.780 --> 05:26.240
intelligence. I am the Fletcher Middle

05:26.240 --> 05:29.620
School librarian, and I was born in 1965

05:29.620 --> 05:33.180
in Boston, and I went to UC Berkeley for

05:33.180 --> 05:36.060
my teaching credential and my master's in

05:36.060 --> 05:38.960
education. And my favorite job of all is

05:38.960 --> 05:41.960
being a middle school teacher librarian. I

05:41.960 --> 05:45.700
am a language arts and music teacher, a

05:45.700 --> 05:48.740
great supporter of all environmental

05:48.740 --> 05:51.340
movements to save this beautiful planet,

05:51.560 --> 05:56.160
Mother Earth. and I recycle very

05:56.160 --> 05:59.460
scrupulously. I grew up in India.

06:00.380 --> 06:03.640
Currently, I'm an enterprise solutions

06:03.640 --> 06:06.980
engineer working in the machine learning

06:06.980 --> 06:09.620
artificial intelligence field. When I was

06:09.620 --> 06:13.140
growing up, I went to college to study

06:13.140 --> 06:17.940
geology and earth sciences, but then I

06:17.940 --> 06:19.700
moved to computer science field.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.340
Currently, I'm working in medical affairs,

06:23.500 --> 06:26.820
working with cancer drugs at a

06:26.820 --> 06:30.040
pharmaceutical company. For fun, I like to

06:30.040 --> 06:34.760
travel, and every year we visit my parents

06:34.760 --> 06:38.300
and relatives in Thailand. I'm a

06:38.300 --> 06:41.040
management consultant. I work mostly in

06:41.040 --> 06:43.580
the life sciences industry doing

06:43.580 --> 06:46.540
technology consulting. I grew up in a

06:46.540 --> 06:49.340
little town in Iowa, northeastern Iowa.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.960
And the last few years, I was a school

06:54.960 --> 06:57.420
librarian at a high school in Fairfax

06:57.420 --> 07:01.300
County. I grew up in Southern California

07:01.300 --> 07:05.020
in Orange County. And then when I got

07:05.020 --> 07:09.220
married, we both worked in technology. And

07:09.220 --> 07:12.020
so we moved up here to the Bay Area. And

07:12.020 --> 07:15.600
then we both have worked in technology and

07:15.600 --> 07:17.400
also have been very involved in the

07:17.400 --> 07:18.960
schools when our kids were in school.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.340
What amazing and diverse participants.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.060
Although all of our students are based in

07:30.060 --> 07:32.180
Palo Alto, the adults they chose to

07:32.180 --> 07:33.660
interview have connections all over the

07:33.660 --> 07:35.720
globe. I can't wait to hear what they have

07:35.720 --> 07:38.720
to say. Absolutely agreed. I think this

07:38.720 --> 07:40.140
really goes to show just how

07:40.140 --> 07:42.720
interconnected our world is nowadays. And

07:42.720 --> 07:44.920
I'm thrilled to hear such a wide variety

07:44.920 --> 07:47.520
of perspectives. Let's hand it over to the

07:47.520 --> 07:48.460
kids to get us started.

07:52.860 --> 07:55.160
Think about a place where you have lived

07:55.160 --> 07:58.580
in or visited for multiple years. How has

07:58.580 --> 08:00.780
the environment in that place changed over

08:00.780 --> 08:04.180
time? Sure. Sure. One of the most popular

08:04.180 --> 08:07.340
places in India is Bangalore. And as

08:07.340 --> 08:10.580
anyone knows right now, Bangalore is

08:10.580 --> 08:12.880
called the Silicon Valley of India. But

08:12.880 --> 08:14.960
when I was growing up, Bangalore was the

08:14.960 --> 08:17.580
most beautiful city with the best weather

08:17.580 --> 08:21.600
and no pollution, less number of people.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.560
It was a beautiful city to grow or visit

08:24.560 --> 08:27.800
for tourism. But as the time passed by,

08:28.040 --> 08:32.000
the tech boom happened and people just

08:32.000 --> 08:35.220
grew exponentially. Now, every time I go

08:35.220 --> 08:37.920
to Bangalore, it's dusty, it's polluted,

08:38.100 --> 08:42.920
it's warm, and it's not that something you

08:42.920 --> 08:45.600
love to live there. It has changed

08:45.600 --> 08:48.360
drastically. I would say like in 25 or 30

08:48.360 --> 08:54.780
years, it has become from a nice, cold and

08:54.780 --> 08:59.040
pleasant city in terms of the weather to

08:59.040 --> 09:03.480
more like hot. Humidity is high now and it

09:03.480 --> 09:07.320
rains too often. I grew up in Busan city

09:07.320 --> 09:10.240
in South Korea. It is a south part of

09:10.240 --> 09:13.360
country. It's near the ocean. It was a

09:13.360 --> 09:16.220
very nice place. The weather was nice. The

09:16.220 --> 09:19.580
air was very clean. There was a mountain

09:19.580 --> 09:23.420
near my town, and it was easily accessible

09:23.420 --> 09:26.940
for everyone. I remember that there was a

09:26.940 --> 09:29.240
little stream, and sometimes my friend and

09:29.240 --> 09:32.300
I went to the air play. We could easily

09:32.300 --> 09:34.920
spot frog spawn and tadpole and small

09:34.920 --> 09:37.960
fishes. It was fun. Well, like about 20

09:37.960 --> 09:40.620
years ago, there was yellow dust,

09:40.760 --> 09:43.660
especially during springtime. Scientists

09:43.660 --> 09:47.160
said that yellow dust from China during

09:47.160 --> 09:50.140
springtime because wind made this yellow

09:50.140 --> 09:54.320
dust blow over the ocean and arrived to

09:54.320 --> 09:57.120
South Korea. But it's usually springtime,

09:57.240 --> 09:59.640
not that long, so people could just

09:59.640 --> 10:02.380
prevent and wear masks during that time.

10:02.380 --> 10:06.720
But however, these days, not only yellow

10:06.720 --> 10:10.340
dust, nowadays they say fine dust. I

10:10.340 --> 10:14.320
remember I went outside with a kid and I

10:14.320 --> 10:17.500
could tell the air is not very clear. And

10:17.500 --> 10:19.640
I got a phone call from my sister-in-law

10:19.640 --> 10:22.900
and, oh, today the fine dust level is very

10:22.900 --> 10:25.040
high. You should stay at home. And I

10:25.040 --> 10:28.440
asked, what is that? And she came to me

10:28.440 --> 10:31.380
and she showed me how to install the Find

10:31.380 --> 10:34.220
Us Index application. And she told me, you

10:34.220 --> 10:36.060
should check it every day. And if the

10:36.060 --> 10:37.820
level is very high, you should stay at

10:37.820 --> 10:40.240
home. It's really, really bad for kids and

10:40.240 --> 10:43.080
older people. And if you have to go out,

10:43.160 --> 10:46.560
you should wear a mask. So that is the new

10:46.560 --> 10:50.660
culture in Korea. I would take my hometown

10:50.660 --> 10:54.620
in India. It's almost kind of a very

10:54.620 --> 10:56.600
hidden gem. It's a hill station tucked

10:56.600 --> 10:59.860
away from the civilization almost. It's

10:59.860 --> 11:03.620
called Wayanad. It's on the southmost tip

11:03.620 --> 11:05.720
of India. As I said, it's a hill station

11:05.720 --> 11:08.360
surrounded by mountain around 8,000 feet

11:08.360 --> 11:11.360
above sea level. The only access to the

11:11.360 --> 11:14.940
place still is a bus route. And that's how

11:14.940 --> 11:17.600
we communicate with the rest of the world.

11:17.820 --> 11:20.440
So the memories of that place is, you

11:20.440 --> 11:22.840
know, it was abundance of nature. or

11:22.840 --> 11:26.120
that's what I can remember most. It was

11:26.120 --> 11:29.360
greenery everywhere, no pollution. When

11:29.360 --> 11:32.360
you walk outside at night, you could see a

11:32.360 --> 11:36.320
full starry sky. Like you couldn't see a

11:36.320 --> 11:38.500
place, locate a place where you don't see

11:38.500 --> 11:41.120
stars. It was that kind of a place. When I

11:41.120 --> 11:44.180
traveled back, I mostly traveled again by

11:44.180 --> 11:46.840
bus. So the first thing that you remember

11:46.840 --> 11:51.540
is as you are climbing a winding hill road

11:51.540 --> 11:55.460
to reach Wayanad, you would suddenly be

11:55.460 --> 11:58.380
hit with lots and lots of fresh air. Even

11:58.380 --> 12:00.760
if I'm sleeping, I would know that I

12:00.760 --> 12:03.940
reached Wayanad by just that breath of

12:03.940 --> 12:07.040
fresh air. So over the years, this fresh

12:07.040 --> 12:11.340
air, this cold wind, and that sweetness of

12:11.340 --> 12:14.260
earth that you can smell, that slowly

12:14.260 --> 12:17.620
started kind of eroding. So it's a little

12:17.620 --> 12:20.900
bit sad to see the place converted to

12:20.900 --> 12:24.840
almost an industrial location where you

12:24.840 --> 12:27.220
could see houses everywhere, roads

12:27.220 --> 12:29.640
everywhere, buildings getting propped up

12:29.640 --> 12:31.740
everywhere. So it's a little bit sad to

12:31.740 --> 12:35.260
see that. The first place I lived overseas

12:35.260 --> 12:41.320
was in Japan, which was Okinawa, but now

12:41.320 --> 12:44.060
that part is all part of Japan. Japan.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.300
It's a very small island. It was right

12:46.300 --> 12:50.220
after World War II. And there were a lot

12:50.220 --> 12:52.600
of damages done to the environment there

12:52.600 --> 12:56.140
because of the war in many places that

12:56.140 --> 12:59.160
were inaccessible to most people because

12:59.160 --> 13:02.140
it had damaged the place so much. And I

13:02.140 --> 13:04.800
understand that now they created a lot of

13:04.800 --> 13:06.940
tourist spots there. And apparently

13:06.940 --> 13:10.660
they've tried to restore the environment

13:10.660 --> 13:14.320
there, beaches and bring back a different

13:14.320 --> 13:17.900
kind of tourist economy. In Germany, we

13:17.900 --> 13:20.560
were there right after, you know, within a

13:20.560 --> 13:23.080
year of that. And there were many places

13:23.080 --> 13:25.620
you couldn't go because they still were

13:25.620 --> 13:28.820
having problems with unexploded bombs and

13:28.820 --> 13:31.740
stuff because you couldn't go there. So we

13:31.740 --> 13:35.680
didn't have a lot of access to just

13:35.680 --> 13:37.900
anywhere we wanted to go in Europe. All

13:37.900 --> 13:39.740
these places you could just walk right up

13:39.740 --> 13:43.600
to the buildings. And we went back there

13:43.600 --> 13:45.360
many years later and you could not do that

13:45.360 --> 13:48.240
because they had been damaged too much,

13:48.240 --> 13:51.660
either by tourists or time. When I was

13:51.660 --> 13:54.340
growing up, Mexico City had the most

13:54.340 --> 13:57.680
incredible environment. What I recall is a

13:57.680 --> 14:00.420
beautiful valley surrounded by mountains

14:00.420 --> 14:04.980
and some of them are huge volcanoes. The

14:04.980 --> 14:07.900
sky was always blue, the air always

14:07.900 --> 14:10.800
transparent. And you could predict the

14:10.800 --> 14:14.120
weather because it ran with clock

14:14.120 --> 14:16.620
perfection. We had a rainy season that

14:16.620 --> 14:19.760
started in May, finished in September. But

14:19.760 --> 14:22.360
that was it. And the fruit that you had

14:22.360 --> 14:24.960
and the vegetables you ate belonged to

14:24.960 --> 14:27.300
that season. Right now, everything has

14:27.300 --> 14:29.840
changed. When I was growing up, this city

14:29.840 --> 14:32.600
had 6 million people. And right now we are

14:32.600 --> 14:34.740
20-something. So the city has grown

14:34.740 --> 14:39.540
incredibly, incredibly, and not with great

14:39.540 --> 14:42.580
order, I would say. Can you please tell me

14:42.580 --> 14:44.560
about a time where you felt that climate

14:44.560 --> 14:47.380
change was impacting a part of your daily

14:47.380 --> 14:50.520
life? The drought we experienced a few

14:50.520 --> 14:54.840
years ago comes to mind. I remember when I

14:54.840 --> 14:58.160
first came to Pau Alto, there was a lot of

14:58.160 --> 15:01.480
rain in the winter and through the month

15:01.480 --> 15:05.040
of April. This is no longer the case and

15:05.040 --> 15:07.920
all of us remember how we had a water

15:07.920 --> 15:11.140
crisis and had to stop washing our cars,

15:11.320 --> 15:15.900
balconies, had to stop watering plants and

15:15.900 --> 15:18.800
change our habits to preserve water. of?

15:19.220 --> 15:21.340
Well, look at right now, we're all sitting

15:21.340 --> 15:24.400
at home and being quarantined. Why?

15:24.580 --> 15:28.520
Because there are some practices that need

15:28.520 --> 15:32.960
to be reviewed. What we eat, how we eat

15:32.960 --> 15:36.340
it, because the viruses come a lot of

15:36.340 --> 15:40.960
times from unhealthy food practices. And

15:40.960 --> 15:43.340
so the ethics of of what we're eating need

15:43.340 --> 15:46.720
to be reviewed in many countries. And

15:46.720 --> 15:52.880
then, yes, the ability to spread any kind

15:52.880 --> 15:55.220
of a problem all over the world quickly,

15:56.240 --> 15:59.200
that is an environmental issue that we're

15:59.200 --> 16:01.420
facing right now because we're so

16:01.420 --> 16:04.200
interconnected through airplanes, through

16:04.200 --> 16:07.400
traveling. Since we can do that, we need

16:07.400 --> 16:10.840
to be very conscious conscious about how

16:10.840 --> 16:14.020
we're behaving and what we are again what

16:14.020 --> 16:16.520
footprint we're leaving behind so i grew

16:16.520 --> 16:21.260
up in india when um companies like talked

16:21.260 --> 16:25.380
about co2 emissions i think more into

16:25.380 --> 16:27.700
general context in india was like people

16:27.700 --> 16:32.080
believed what was there but then um what

16:32.080 --> 16:33.960
happened was there were some industry

16:33.960 --> 16:36.460
disasters that happened in india i

16:36.460 --> 16:39.000
remember back in 70s and 80s, there were

16:39.000 --> 16:41.420
poisonous gases released in the atmosphere

16:41.420 --> 16:45.440
during something that happened with the

16:45.440 --> 16:49.300
industrial complex, and it caused a lot of

16:49.300 --> 16:52.220
deaths. So I think if I go back, I think

16:52.220 --> 16:54.600
in my memory only, I think the focus was

16:54.600 --> 16:57.360
always on these kind of life-threatening

16:57.360 --> 17:02.120
disasters rather than CO2 emissions, to my

17:02.120 --> 17:03.560
awareness. I don't think people paid

17:03.560 --> 17:06.640
enough attention to CO2 emissions back in

17:06.640 --> 17:08.820
the day. Do you think the general populace

17:08.820 --> 17:11.860
in your area were aware of climate change

17:11.860 --> 17:15.520
back then? Absolutely not. I don't think

17:15.520 --> 17:19.080
there was any awareness or even now there

17:19.080 --> 17:20.480
is awareness for climate change.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.540
Definitely the pollution, the industrial

17:24.540 --> 17:27.000
hazards that happened there, those were

17:27.000 --> 17:30.600
the concerns. But if I talk to most of the

17:30.600 --> 17:32.660
people back home in India, I don't think

17:32.660 --> 17:35.500
anybody knows the impact or the

17:35.500 --> 17:39.240
consequences of climate change. Even if

17:39.240 --> 17:41.260
you don't believe in the root cause,

17:41.500 --> 17:43.780
that's because of pollution or not, but we

17:43.780 --> 17:45.220
all know that the temperature of the

17:45.220 --> 17:47.440
planet is rising and it will have

17:47.440 --> 17:50.540
consequences. I don't think anybody's

17:50.540 --> 17:52.840
paying attention to that. I think it's

17:52.840 --> 17:55.000
probably the same in the United States. If

17:55.000 --> 17:56.680
you look at most of the cities, the big

17:56.680 --> 17:58.940
cities like New York, San Francisco,

17:59.260 --> 18:02.480
Houston, they're all on the coast. So if

18:02.480 --> 18:05.160
the temperature keeps rising, these cities

18:05.160 --> 18:07.180
won't exist anymore. But I think people

18:07.180 --> 18:10.200
think somehow it will solve itself, or

18:10.200 --> 18:13.160
honestly, people are not thinking long

18:13.160 --> 18:15.960
-term, in my opinion. What are your

18:15.960 --> 18:17.600
thoughts about the environment right now

18:17.600 --> 18:19.560
compared to the environment 15 years ago?

18:19.960 --> 18:22.480
I think about it a lot now. I mean,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.780
there's so much written about it, and we

18:24.780 --> 18:28.120
see so many pictures. We really never gave

18:28.120 --> 18:31.380
it a thought. never read or heard about it

18:31.380 --> 18:34.520
50 years ago. And now you just see

18:34.520 --> 18:37.820
pictures of it happening. I think it's in

18:37.820 --> 18:42.080
the forefront of all of our minds now. I

18:42.080 --> 18:44.980
hardly think you could talk to anyone who

18:44.980 --> 18:47.420
didn't think that it's happening.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.460
I don't know about you, but I'm finding it

18:55.460 --> 18:57.400
fascinating to hear from these folks about

18:57.400 --> 18:59.360
the changes they've witnessed, both in the

18:59.360 --> 19:00.760
sense of physical changes to the

19:00.760 --> 19:02.820
environment, as well as in social and

19:02.820 --> 19:04.680
cultural awareness about how humans are

19:04.680 --> 19:07.280
impacting the climate. Yeah, absolutely. I

19:07.280 --> 19:09.100
think they've done a fantastic job

19:09.100 --> 19:11.200
capturing what climate change really looks

19:11.200 --> 19:14.240
like on a human scale. It's almost

19:14.240 --> 19:16.520
disheartening to hear all of these

19:16.520 --> 19:19.260
dramatic personal stories of how much the

19:19.260 --> 19:21.820
earth has changed. Honestly, it's a little

19:21.820 --> 19:24.140
scary to think about. But at the same

19:24.140 --> 19:26.300
time, it's so encouraging to hear about

19:26.300 --> 19:28.840
how our awareness is growing, to know that

19:28.840 --> 19:31.480
people are paying more and more attention

19:31.480 --> 19:34.620
to these issues. I agree. Their message

19:34.620 --> 19:37.280
makes me feel very hopeful too. But let's

19:37.280 --> 19:39.060
also build some scientific context around

19:39.060 --> 19:40.600
the stories we've been hearing and talk

19:40.600 --> 19:42.020
about what the changes have looked like at

19:42.020 --> 19:45.140
a global scale. Sure, definitely. So this

19:45.140 --> 19:47.680
past year was the second warmest year on

19:47.680 --> 19:51.160
record globally. And July of 2019 was the

19:51.160 --> 19:55.380
hottest month in California ever. Since

19:55.380 --> 19:58.580
that very first Earth Day in 1970, our

19:58.580 --> 20:01.600
atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by

20:01.600 --> 20:05.420
26%, and every year we reach a new record

20:05.420 --> 20:08.320
high. The human population has also grown

20:08.320 --> 20:11.660
from 3.7 billion people in 1970 to close

20:11.660 --> 20:13.740
to 8 billion today, thus greatly

20:13.740 --> 20:15.860
increasing our ability as a species to

20:15.860 --> 20:17.600
make a lasting impact on the world around

20:17.600 --> 20:20.500
us. Yeah, I think these numbers can be be

20:20.500 --> 20:23.340
really shocking. They are super important

20:23.340 --> 20:25.740
and they do a great job of highlighting

20:25.740 --> 20:28.960
big changes and trends. But I also

20:28.960 --> 20:31.440
understand that for many of us, they are

20:31.440 --> 20:34.220
just big numbers and percentages and they

20:34.220 --> 20:37.120
don't mean much on their own. But these

20:37.120 --> 20:40.080
big numbers are causing real changes here

20:40.080 --> 20:42.880
and now. These drastic changes we've heard

20:42.880 --> 20:45.180
a lot about, the way people's lives are

20:45.180 --> 20:48.020
being impacted today, that is what these

20:48.020 --> 20:50.380
numbers are telling us. You're completely

20:50.380 --> 20:52.620
right. What's most important is the issues

20:52.620 --> 20:54.320
that these climate conditions can cause

20:54.320 --> 20:56.240
for our communities as well as for our

20:56.240 --> 20:58.660
environment. Let's go ahead and turn

20:58.660 --> 21:00.260
things back over to our students and their

21:00.260 --> 21:02.060
interviewees to hear more about how these

21:02.060 --> 21:04.420
issues manifest in their lives and what we

21:04.420 --> 21:07.120
can do individually and as a society to

21:07.120 --> 21:07.740
address them.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.880
can you describe the most important

21:13.880 --> 21:16.440
environmental issue in your opinion and

21:16.440 --> 21:21.440
why it's important pollution the the

21:21.440 --> 21:24.280
carbon emissions from cars and everyone on

21:24.280 --> 21:26.020
the road rushing to get to where they are

21:26.020 --> 21:30.080
if you look at the coronavirus pandemic

21:30.080 --> 21:33.340
with everyone sheltering in pace you can

21:33.340 --> 21:37.080
see that la our area, the pollution has

21:37.080 --> 21:40.140
been cut back or cut down because nobody's

21:40.140 --> 21:42.640
on the road using their cars. To me,

21:42.760 --> 21:47.760
rising sea level is the most, I would say,

21:47.800 --> 21:51.500
important environmental issue because that

21:51.500 --> 21:55.280
is causing a lot of smaller islands

21:55.280 --> 21:58.640
getting submerged by the sea level rise.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.180
So people are losing their places to live

22:02.180 --> 22:06.560
and animals or like sea animals, they're

22:06.560 --> 22:09.660
having trouble in terms of the pollution

22:09.660 --> 22:14.040
in the ocean. I think climate change is so

22:14.040 --> 22:17.020
important, not just for us here in

22:17.020 --> 22:19.200
California, where we've seen these raging

22:19.200 --> 22:22.780
wildfires, but around the world. And it

22:22.780 --> 22:26.660
just enrages me that we have people who

22:26.660 --> 22:30.400
are naysayers and denying the science. if

22:30.400 --> 22:32.940
you just look at the shrinkage of the ice,

22:33.020 --> 22:34.840
the polar ice, and you just watch that.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.600
And then you see these pictures of the

22:36.600 --> 22:39.300
starving polar bears. I mean, if that

22:39.300 --> 22:40.980
doesn't move someone, I don't know what

22:40.980 --> 22:42.560
will. And that's just talking about the

22:42.560 --> 22:44.280
animal population. But then you think

22:44.280 --> 22:46.720
about all the floods we've been having and

22:46.720 --> 22:50.060
all the horrific extreme weather. It's all

22:50.060 --> 22:51.900
linked to climate change. And I don't

22:51.900 --> 22:54.360
understand why we're not able to get it

22:54.360 --> 22:56.940
together, especially as a country. The

22:56.940 --> 22:59.580
fact that that we took ourselves out of

22:59.580 --> 23:01.600
the international agreements is so

23:01.600 --> 23:04.200
embarrassing because we're supposed to be

23:04.540 --> 23:07.040
this leader of nations and we're not

23:07.040 --> 23:09.720
leading. I still don't see any clear

23:09.720 --> 23:12.760
action or a strong guide from government.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.780
It's just true that glaciers are melting

23:15.780 --> 23:19.400
every year due to global warming. All our

23:19.400 --> 23:22.840
animal habitats are destroyed. Also, it'll

23:22.840 --> 23:25.860
impact the ecosystem. If ecosystem is

23:25.860 --> 23:28.080
destroyed, Showing people that is safe,

23:28.140 --> 23:31.220
too. I'm really worried. Do you think that

23:31.220 --> 23:33.740
more public recognition from events like

23:33.740 --> 23:35.500
Earth Day has helped the climate improve?

23:36.460 --> 23:40.900
Yes, I do. The first Earth Day was a very

23:40.900 --> 23:43.780
big deal. I mean, I remember it very

23:43.780 --> 23:46.320
clearly. I was in college. I think that

23:46.320 --> 23:48.840
that's brought a lot of attention over the

23:48.840 --> 23:51.420
years, along with other measures. I come

23:51.420 --> 23:54.080
from a marketing background, and so I know

23:54.080 --> 23:56.020
it's very important to always get the word

23:56.020 --> 23:59.020
out so people really understand what the

23:59.020 --> 24:02.920
issues are. And so Earth Day, it's really

24:02.920 --> 24:06.800
a marketing ploy that brings attention to

24:06.800 --> 24:09.100
the issues. And I think it's very

24:09.100 --> 24:10.360
important because that's the way that you

24:10.360 --> 24:12.060
can communicate and hopefully get people

24:12.060 --> 24:13.960
involved in activities. activities. For

24:13.960 --> 24:16.520
instance, a typical Earth Day activity

24:16.520 --> 24:18.460
might be to go out and clean up the creeks

24:18.460 --> 24:21.020
or the beaches. And by people

24:21.020 --> 24:23.140
participating in this, I think it gives

24:23.140 --> 24:25.820
them a real hands-on experience as far as

24:25.820 --> 24:28.960
why it's important and what it is out

24:28.960 --> 24:30.920
there and how they can help. And that may

24:30.920 --> 24:33.500
make them expand their view beyond just

24:33.500 --> 24:35.380
that beach that they're cleaning up. I

24:35.380 --> 24:39.260
think it's a a piece of the whole puzzle.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.360
Nothing in life is, I think, just a one

24:42.360 --> 24:46.700
-shot deal. So when you say it takes a

24:46.700 --> 24:50.820
village to do something, I think that's a

24:50.820 --> 24:53.040
good analogy here, that it takes a

24:53.040 --> 24:55.460
village. So you need things on many

24:55.460 --> 24:59.580
different levels so that people will

24:59.580 --> 25:02.380
understand it on different levels, and

25:02.380 --> 25:07.740
that it can make an impact locally,

25:08.560 --> 25:12.480
statewide, federally, nationwide, and

25:12.480 --> 25:14.640
internationally. And so I think it's very

25:14.640 --> 25:17.520
important to have different pieces that

25:17.520 --> 25:21.200
are going to all work together to move the

25:21.200 --> 25:25.380
goals forward. Do you think that evolution

25:25.380 --> 25:28.080
in technology is doing more or less good

25:28.080 --> 25:30.480
for the environment? I'm divided in my

25:30.480 --> 25:33.700
opinion. I think, you know, I say humans

25:33.700 --> 25:36.720
are progressive. We are inquisitively

25:36.720 --> 25:39.000
curious. I think the technological

25:39.000 --> 25:41.340
progress that we are making is quite

25:41.340 --> 25:44.840
natural. And somehow we cannot prevent

25:44.840 --> 25:48.300
that. And that's how we as a human society

25:48.300 --> 25:52.400
evolved. But I'm also not here to deny the

25:52.400 --> 25:54.480
negative influence of technology that it

25:54.480 --> 25:57.280
has been. And in my own life, I can see

25:57.280 --> 25:59.200
that even within a family, Like, you know,

25:59.200 --> 26:02.520
the interactions that we have are

26:02.520 --> 26:04.760
tremendously influenced, you know,

26:04.780 --> 26:07.240
negative influence of technology. But I

26:07.240 --> 26:09.180
wouldn't say, you know, the solution is

26:09.180 --> 26:12.120
let's go back and do not use technology.

26:12.420 --> 26:15.080
Even the crisis that we are going through

26:15.080 --> 26:18.220
now because of the pandemic, we are all

26:18.220 --> 26:23.640
forced to be socially distant and be at

26:23.640 --> 26:26.680
home. and I think you know this is a time

26:26.680 --> 26:30.880
for us to reflect and slow down because we

26:30.880 --> 26:32.880
all think that you know we have to get so

26:32.880 --> 26:35.260
many things done but nothing would happen

26:35.260 --> 26:39.200
if we just slow down and relax at home one

26:39.200 --> 26:41.160
day and we should go in that direction

26:41.160 --> 26:43.740
it's not technology that is bad or good

26:43.740 --> 26:45.960
influence but you know it's it's we as

26:45.960 --> 26:49.880
humans who needs to think what is good for

26:49.880 --> 26:52.400
us and needs to balance them is that. Can

26:52.400 --> 26:54.320
you walk me through one action we can take

26:54.320 --> 26:56.640
to make a difference today? I think that

26:56.640 --> 27:00.400
pollution stems from overuse and waste.

27:01.080 --> 27:04.620
So, you know, like air pollution, you

27:04.620 --> 27:07.640
know, comes from the use of all the cars

27:07.640 --> 27:09.580
on the street, all these transportation,

27:10.100 --> 27:13.860
the factories, burning fuel, Water

27:13.860 --> 27:17.040
pollution comes from all the waste and

27:17.040 --> 27:21.760
trash and the plastics. So we can do a lot

27:21.760 --> 27:25.500
to decrease pollution by being more

27:25.500 --> 27:28.820
mindful of the waste that we generate. So

27:28.820 --> 27:33.100
recycling of things, not just recycling of

27:33.100 --> 27:36.440
water bottles and whatnot or containers,

27:36.540 --> 27:40.000
but really recycling of everyday products.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.400
Think about the iPhones that we keep

27:43.400 --> 27:47.000
having to update and upgrade and all the

27:47.000 --> 27:50.580
waste that's associated with that. Or just

27:50.580 --> 27:53.820
all the shoes and clothes that everyone

27:53.820 --> 27:57.240
needs to buy to be trendy. So I think

27:57.240 --> 28:00.500
that, you know, just cutting down on all

28:00.500 --> 28:05.200
these waste and all these basics can go a

28:05.200 --> 28:09.860
long way to cut down pollution. I remember

28:09.860 --> 28:13.520
being in Milan, Italy last year, and I saw

28:13.520 --> 28:16.300
that they are planting trees on the side

28:16.300 --> 28:20.000
of buildings and on the rooftop. So then

28:20.000 --> 28:22.640
even if they have to cut trees from the

28:22.640 --> 28:25.080
ground to build an apartment building or

28:25.080 --> 28:29.280
something else, then they make it up by

28:29.280 --> 28:31.560
planting trees on top or everywhere

28:31.560 --> 28:36.240
possible. And I think we can try to do

28:36.240 --> 28:39.440
that here. We can do more walking and

28:39.440 --> 28:41.800
bicycling to the grocery stores, walk to

28:41.800 --> 28:43.480
Safeway, things like that. We could do

28:43.480 --> 28:45.300
more of that instead of taking these short

28:45.300 --> 28:47.480
little trips because we want to make

28:47.480 --> 28:49.940
everything happen so quickly. And then we

28:49.940 --> 28:51.520
would have more time to look at the trees

28:51.520 --> 28:52.940
and the greenery and the cherry blossoms

28:52.940 --> 28:55.740
blooming. We need to change what we're

28:55.740 --> 29:00.060
doing now. I don't know how. That's what I

29:00.060 --> 29:04.780
have to have the scientists tell us. But I

29:04.780 --> 29:06.540
know there are things, you know, little

29:06.540 --> 29:08.680
things we can do. Like my daughter-in-law

29:08.680 --> 29:11.380
suggested that I use cloth napkins instead

29:11.380 --> 29:15.340
of paper. So I'm doing that to save on

29:15.340 --> 29:17.980
paper. And then I bought these rubber

29:17.980 --> 29:20.060
gizmos. I don't even know what you call

29:20.060 --> 29:22.380
them. They're leftovers that can be thrown

29:22.380 --> 29:24.940
in the dishwasher rather than using

29:24.940 --> 29:28.360
plastic wrap and baggies.

29:30.340 --> 29:33.080
and we've got to drink more water from the

29:33.080 --> 29:35.800
faucet. We just have to be more thoughtful

29:35.800 --> 29:40.880
about what we're doing and remember that

29:40.880 --> 29:43.200
it's not going to help the environment, so

29:43.200 --> 29:47.000
maybe choose something that would help the

29:47.000 --> 29:50.980
environment. I do think that each one of

29:50.980 --> 29:55.080
us carries a responsibility for what we

29:55.080 --> 29:58.380
can do to make a difference. so that's at

29:58.380 --> 30:00.860
our personal level but I think it's also

30:00.860 --> 30:03.920
very important for us to go up to the

30:03.920 --> 30:06.020
level beyond the individual and that would

30:06.020 --> 30:08.360
be to your city level and to work with

30:08.360 --> 30:10.600
your city city of Palo Alto for instance

30:10.600 --> 30:14.020
then beyond the the city I think it's very

30:14.020 --> 30:15.780
important to work at the county level the

30:15.780 --> 30:17.580
state level federal level and an

30:17.580 --> 30:19.060
international level so I think there's

30:19.060 --> 30:21.400
steps each place along the way and there

30:21.400 --> 30:23.760
has to be coordination especially at the

30:23.760 --> 30:25.440
international national level. Because if

30:25.440 --> 30:29.280
all countries are not trying to care for

30:29.280 --> 30:32.660
the ocean and what's happening there, then

30:32.660 --> 30:36.680
we're going to lose hundreds and thousands

30:36.680 --> 30:39.560
of species and plants and reefs and

30:39.560 --> 30:42.640
whatnot. Dear librarian, what role do you

30:42.640 --> 30:45.240
think libraries and reading can and should

30:45.240 --> 30:47.280
play in helping people learn about climate

30:47.280 --> 30:49.320
change and the environment? Oh, that's a

30:49.320 --> 30:52.240
good question. Yes, Yes, libraries really

30:52.240 --> 30:55.500
can do a lot for that because that's where

30:55.500 --> 30:58.300
you get information. You get help finding

30:58.300 --> 31:00.940
information about it. You have things that

31:00.940 --> 31:03.300
are presented to you in such a way that it

31:03.300 --> 31:07.100
encourages you to read more and do

31:07.100 --> 31:08.960
projects that are related to the

31:08.960 --> 31:11.640
environment. And all of that is something

31:11.640 --> 31:13.900
that librarians really promote. Not

31:13.900 --> 31:16.180
everything is available just on the

31:16.180 --> 31:20.600
internet without being taught how to

31:20.600 --> 31:23.440
decide whether something is factual or

31:23.440 --> 31:27.220
not. Librarians work very hard in trying

31:27.220 --> 31:30.700
to teach students how to be good consumers

31:30.700 --> 31:32.920
of information and how to decide what's

31:32.920 --> 31:36.300
fact and what is fiction. Is there

31:36.300 --> 31:38.200
anything important that you think kids my

31:38.200 --> 31:40.080
age need to know or do to make sure the

31:40.080 --> 31:42.020
environment keeps getting better? What

31:42.020 --> 31:44.060
advice would you have for me? You should

31:44.060 --> 31:46.740
probably look for information, and your

31:46.740 --> 31:48.940
librarians might be able to recommend

31:48.940 --> 31:51.580
things to you that would have to do with

31:51.580 --> 31:54.920
the environment. Reading books that are

31:54.920 --> 31:58.820
even fiction that take place in different

31:58.820 --> 32:00.680
environmental settings that you become

32:00.680 --> 32:03.900
more aware of it. But I think that doing

32:03.900 --> 32:07.680
projects where you have to research all

32:07.680 --> 32:10.040
different angles of an environmental

32:10.040 --> 32:12.460
problem are one of the most valuable you

32:12.460 --> 32:14.660
could do. I think everyone needs to be

32:14.660 --> 32:17.100
more mindful every day with everything

32:17.100 --> 32:21.080
that they do, whether or not the

32:21.080 --> 32:23.980
environment can be impacted by their

32:23.980 --> 32:29.080
actions and to be educated about what they

32:29.080 --> 32:35.240
can do and to constantly get information

32:35.240 --> 32:37.520
about what they can do to help the

32:37.520 --> 32:40.340
environment. And most important of all,

32:40.460 --> 32:44.240
not to be wasteful. I remember when I was

32:44.240 --> 32:47.140
a fourth grade teacher, we were, I had a

32:47.140 --> 32:50.360
unit on trash and we were weighing our

32:50.360 --> 32:53.040
trash. We were competing against another

32:53.040 --> 32:54.900
classroom to see who could have the least

32:54.900 --> 32:56.500
amount of trash. We had a trash free

32:56.500 --> 32:58.740
lunch. These are all things I think we

32:58.740 --> 33:00.680
definitely could implement at our school.

33:00.860 --> 33:05.340
And I know that when kids are educated,

33:05.620 --> 33:09.440
they educate their parents. So I remember,

33:09.500 --> 33:11.740
you know, the difference. My own kids

33:11.740 --> 33:13.000
would come home after learning something

33:13.000 --> 33:15.420
at school. Hey, we learned this in school.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.440
Like, oh my gosh, that's, thank you.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.520
That's, I think that's a great idea. So I

33:20.520 --> 33:22.860
really think that we can impact the change

33:22.860 --> 33:25.360
of the adults by starting with our own

33:25.360 --> 33:27.640
kids at our school. I would tell them to

33:27.640 --> 33:30.920
be thankful. Thankful for the planet we

33:30.920 --> 33:34.420
have, which is wonderful. And we cannot

33:34.420 --> 33:38.100
waste it anymore. And we are doing a very

33:38.100 --> 33:42.000
good job cutting trees, polluting beaches.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.620
You cannot change the world by yourself,

33:45.840 --> 33:47.680
but you can change, as I told you, your

33:47.680 --> 33:51.400
life. If everyone introduced in their

33:51.400 --> 33:54.720
lives environmental policies, things would

33:54.720 --> 33:57.340
get better. And we are seeing it today.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.040
Things have changed in two weeks of

34:00.040 --> 34:03.420
seclusion. What I would tell them is to

34:03.420 --> 34:05.640
take care of themselves, to take care of

34:05.640 --> 34:08.300
their families, to take care of the

34:08.300 --> 34:11.660
children, of the old people, being more

34:11.660 --> 34:15.200
aware of one another. If we do that, of

34:15.200 --> 34:18.480
course, we will also lead a responsible

34:18.480 --> 34:21.920
life regarding weather, pollution and

34:21.920 --> 34:24.400
everything you tell me. What we really

34:24.400 --> 34:27.320
need and desperately are values, values,

34:27.500 --> 34:30.900
values, values. I am very sure because I'm

34:30.900 --> 34:33.540
very optimistic that this situation that

34:33.540 --> 34:36.260
we are going through right now is going to

34:36.260 --> 34:39.260
change the way we lead our lives. Well,

34:39.380 --> 34:41.360
now I'm going to say something very

34:41.360 --> 34:45.340
philosophical. It's up to you guys of your

34:45.340 --> 34:49.000
generation. so i think the more people

34:49.000 --> 34:52.420
like you of your age get interested and

34:52.420 --> 34:56.740
really concerned with how to fix some of

34:56.740 --> 34:59.200
the problems the better the planet the

34:59.200 --> 35:02.040
better off planet will be and all of us

35:02.040 --> 35:07.220
living on it so i think that uh they are

35:07.220 --> 35:09.900
enough activists of my generation

35:09.900 --> 35:13.260
generation and enough activists of our

35:13.260 --> 35:17.140
host generation to work it all together.

35:17.420 --> 35:19.820
And yes, I think there is a huge, strong

35:19.820 --> 35:24.280
chance, especially after this pandemic

35:24.280 --> 35:26.820
that we're living in right now. I'm hoping

35:26.820 --> 35:30.080
that it will serve as an amazing lesson to

35:30.080 --> 35:32.620
how quickly we can actually stop doing

35:32.620 --> 35:35.460
wrong things and bad things, shut down all

35:35.460 --> 35:38.200
the factories that are emitting all the

35:38.200 --> 35:40.960
terrible gases and the air is cleaning

35:40.960 --> 35:43.800
within three weeks the waters are cleaning

35:43.800 --> 35:46.520
within two weeks in the rivers if people

35:46.520 --> 35:50.240
stop adding pollutants into it so I think

35:50.240 --> 35:52.580
the planet is ready to cooperate with us

35:52.580 --> 35:56.240
and I think if countries governments

35:56.240 --> 35:59.160
people like you like me and like people

35:59.160 --> 36:02.560
who are doing this radio program today if

36:02.560 --> 36:04.620
we're all get our minds together I think

36:04.620 --> 36:06.100
in 50 years we can have have a clean

36:06.100 --> 36:06.520
environment.

36:12.820 --> 36:15.500
Can I just say, I am so impressed with our

36:15.500 --> 36:17.460
student interviewers and the questions

36:17.460 --> 36:19.920
that they've come up with. I'm just really

36:19.920 --> 36:21.960
glad they're asking about lessons learned

36:21.960 --> 36:25.300
and for messages that these adults want to

36:25.300 --> 36:27.600
share with their generation. I completely

36:27.600 --> 36:29.700
agree. I think talking about these

36:29.700 --> 36:31.000
environmental issues can be really

36:31.000 --> 36:33.140
disheartening sometimes, times, so I'm so

36:33.140 --> 36:34.880
glad to see how forward-thinking both our

36:34.880 --> 36:37.720
students and our adults are. I'm also

36:37.720 --> 36:39.560
really excited to see them thinking of

36:39.560 --> 36:41.260
climate change as an intergenerational

36:41.260 --> 36:43.380
issue and finding ways to share knowledge

36:43.380 --> 36:45.900
with each other. So I think this is a

36:45.900 --> 36:48.100
great point to transition over to hearing

36:48.100 --> 36:49.920
from the kids and their perspectives on

36:49.920 --> 36:52.420
the environment. But first, I'd like to

36:52.420 --> 36:53.740
take a quick moment to share another

36:53.740 --> 36:57.300
announcement about the coronavirus. Second

36:57.300 --> 36:59.420
Harvest of Silicon has always been

36:59.420 --> 37:01.200
committed to the most vulnerable in our

37:01.200 --> 37:04.220
community. During the COVID-19 outbreak,

37:04.420 --> 37:06.960
with its related economic impacts, your

37:06.960 --> 37:08.740
neighbors need your help now more than

37:08.740 --> 37:11.220
ever. You can donate food or provide

37:11.220 --> 37:14.220
monetary assistance. And if you're in good

37:14.220 --> 37:16.320
health and not in a high-risk category,

37:16.680 --> 37:19.120
you can also volunteer to pre-box or

37:19.120 --> 37:22.020
distribute food to those in need. For more

37:22.020 --> 37:25.680
information on how to help, visit shfb

37:25.680 --> 37:31.960
.org. That's shfb.org or call 866-234

37:31.960 --> 37:33.700
-3663.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.080
Yeah, thanks Lexi. So to start off, we

37:38.080 --> 37:39.840
asked the students what they want to be

37:39.840 --> 37:42.060
when they're older to get a sense of what

37:42.060 --> 37:43.960
they're interested in and what they care

37:43.960 --> 37:47.200
about. So now let's meet all the students

37:47.200 --> 37:53.740
we'll be talking to today. today um

37:53.740 --> 37:57.080
my dream or my the job that i want to be

37:57.080 --> 38:00.060
like when i get older is a doctor so i can

38:00.060 --> 38:03.620
help people like that is like struggling

38:03.620 --> 38:06.860
with whatever stuff so like to save

38:06.860 --> 38:10.460
people's life like more than even one

38:10.460 --> 38:13.280
because every person is like can do every

38:13.280 --> 38:15.280
something that is affected to everything

38:15.280 --> 38:17.800
things when I'm older I really want to be

38:17.800 --> 38:21.620
a psychologist because I find just the

38:21.620 --> 38:24.700
brains of people to be very interesting

38:24.700 --> 38:28.040
and it's just so crazy to think that there

38:28.040 --> 38:30.860
are scientific things going on in people's

38:30.860 --> 38:32.940
heads when they do things and say things

38:32.940 --> 38:36.120
and I want to help others without having

38:36.120 --> 38:37.760
to look at blood because I can't be a

38:37.760 --> 38:41.180
doctor architecture because I really like

38:41.180 --> 38:45.040
um the The way how all of that process

38:45.040 --> 38:48.200
involved in making these amazing buildings

38:49.300 --> 38:52.820
or these amazing houses or bridges. I

38:52.820 --> 38:55.560
think the process is really cool. I want

38:55.560 --> 38:59.320
to be a lawyer. This is funny, but arguing

38:59.320 --> 39:01.220
has always been one of my specialties.

39:02.160 --> 39:05.260
Actually, a lot of people say that. And I

39:05.260 --> 39:08.600
always found law very interesting. Either

39:08.600 --> 39:11.940
a doctor to help save lives. And

39:11.940 --> 39:14.060
especially the doctors now who are helping

39:14.060 --> 39:16.120
with the coronavirus. Those people really

39:16.120 --> 39:18.740
inspire me. But I would also want to be a

39:18.740 --> 39:22.480
computer engineer. Like most people, I'm

39:22.480 --> 39:24.880
not sure yet. But I know that I definitely

39:24.880 --> 39:26.820
want to keep dance in my life because

39:26.820 --> 39:28.820
that's a big part of my life. And I also

39:28.820 --> 39:30.740
want to do something either like related

39:30.740 --> 39:32.840
to the environment or like helping people.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.580
So I might become an environmentalist or

39:35.580 --> 39:38.020
like a scientist or something. And I also

39:38.020 --> 39:40.740
really enjoy math. so there's a lot of

39:40.740 --> 39:41.900
options but I definitely want to do

39:41.900 --> 39:44.100
something that helps people and our

39:44.100 --> 39:47.160
environment I honestly want in the

39:47.160 --> 39:49.260
beginning I always wanted to be a movie

39:49.260 --> 39:51.780
director but these days I actually want to

39:51.780 --> 39:54.540
be either a um someone working in the

39:54.540 --> 39:56.740
broadcast team because I actually feel

39:56.740 --> 39:58.180
like I'm really good at recording things

39:58.180 --> 40:00.920
or I want to be game designer because

40:00.920 --> 40:04.620
usually I have um some interesting ideas I

40:04.620 --> 40:06.700
don't know kind of an undecided but I

40:06.700 --> 40:07.920
would like to do something creative

40:07.920 --> 40:10.380
because like I really like to like sing

40:10.380 --> 40:13.180
and draw that kind of stuff even though

40:13.180 --> 40:16.940
it's kind of risky but I don't know. I

40:16.940 --> 40:19.740
want to be an architect because I want to

40:19.740 --> 40:22.420
I know that a lot of people need homes and

40:22.420 --> 40:24.780
I want to make sure everyone can find

40:24.780 --> 40:27.680
affordable affordable housing. I really

40:27.680 --> 40:30.940
enjoy working with animals so like I go

40:30.940 --> 40:33.660
out on the farm and all that like with

40:33.660 --> 40:36.760
horses especially and maybe like designer

40:36.760 --> 40:40.700
for animals like like not like clothes but

40:40.700 --> 40:43.340
like for horses for example like saddles

40:43.340 --> 40:46.760
and stuff like that I kind of like coding

40:46.760 --> 40:49.880
so potentially something related to coding

40:49.880 --> 40:52.740
or software development the way you can

40:52.740 --> 40:55.080
express what you want to do and make

40:55.080 --> 40:59.660
something that is your own? A job where I

40:59.660 --> 41:02.980
have power to make like decisions and

41:02.980 --> 41:07.800
impact because well I've grown up like in

41:07.800 --> 41:10.100
a place where like my parents were making

41:10.100 --> 41:12.920
decisions that impacted people and I think

41:12.920 --> 41:14.760
that I could really use that for the good.

41:15.020 --> 41:17.160
I definitely want to be something that

41:17.160 --> 41:20.220
like positively impacts people in the

41:20.220 --> 41:23.740
environment such as like a doctor or like

41:23.740 --> 41:25.580
a a scientist that studies the

41:25.580 --> 41:26.060
environment.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.040
These are some really cool kids who

41:34.040 --> 41:35.860
certainly aspire to make the world a

41:35.860 --> 41:37.560
better place in any way that they can.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.580
Yeah, they're such an awesome mix of

41:39.580 --> 41:41.900
interests, and they're all clearly very

41:41.900 --> 41:44.640
thoughtful and compassionate. I also think

41:44.640 --> 41:46.760
it's important for our listeners to know

41:46.760 --> 41:49.400
that these kids were not selected because

41:49.400 --> 41:51.240
they had extensive backgrounds in

41:51.240 --> 41:53.660
environmental science, but because they

41:53.660 --> 41:55.640
have a wide variety of interests ranging

41:55.640 --> 41:58.900
from sustainability to public speaking to

41:58.900 --> 42:02.200
audio production and journalism. That's

42:02.200 --> 42:04.200
right. Although we do have students who

42:04.200 --> 42:05.360
are involved in their school's

42:05.360 --> 42:08.100
environmentally focused club, we also have

42:08.100 --> 42:09.640
students from their broadcasting program

42:09.640 --> 42:12.400
and student leadership as well. They'll

42:12.400 --> 42:13.620
definitely bring some really cool

42:13.620 --> 42:15.820
perspectives to this conversation. So

42:15.820 --> 42:17.060
let's go ahead and dive into these

42:17.060 --> 42:18.560
interviews and hear what they have to say.

42:23.900 --> 42:26.060
Thank you all so much for agreeing to

42:26.060 --> 42:27.800
speak with us. And we're so excited to

42:27.800 --> 42:29.480
hear what you have to say about today's

42:29.480 --> 42:31.540
environmental issues and your visions for

42:31.540 --> 42:34.000
the future. But to start off, just so

42:34.000 --> 42:36.180
we're all on the same page, how would you

42:36.180 --> 42:38.480
define the environment? In other words,

42:38.480 --> 42:40.460
what does the environment mean to you?

42:41.360 --> 42:43.940
When I think about environment, I see like

42:43.940 --> 42:48.160
green and I see like trees and bushes and

42:48.160 --> 42:51.400
flowers. flowers, and I see it as like a

42:51.400 --> 42:55.000
pretty thing, I guess. I just think about

42:55.000 --> 42:56.360
like the earth when I think about

42:56.360 --> 42:59.180
environment and like saving it and helping

42:59.180 --> 43:01.720
it grow so the next generations can

43:01.720 --> 43:05.460
experience the earth we see. When I hear

43:05.460 --> 43:07.840
environment, I think a lot about nature.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.840
So I think about like trees and grass and

43:10.840 --> 43:13.340
so in the environment, some words that

43:13.340 --> 43:16.620
come to mind are rain, sun, but also Also

43:16.620 --> 43:19.340
things like climate change and drought.

43:19.820 --> 43:22.580
And so when I think of the environment, I

43:22.580 --> 43:24.000
just think of a lot of people trying to

43:24.000 --> 43:27.060
get together to improve something. And I

43:27.060 --> 43:28.360
know that there's a lot of ways to help

43:28.360 --> 43:30.600
the environment. And there's a lot of

43:30.600 --> 43:31.920
things that we're doing that have also

43:31.920 --> 43:34.000
impacted the environment negatively. It's

43:34.000 --> 43:35.780
something that we're all trying to make a

43:35.780 --> 43:38.080
better place. And I hope that we can do

43:38.080 --> 43:42.140
that. A huge place that people need to

43:42.140 --> 43:45.200
stay. Maybe it's kind of weird, But like

43:45.200 --> 43:48.120
we need the environment to like stay alive

43:48.120 --> 43:50.420
or like stay healthy. And like if we kind

43:50.420 --> 43:52.520
of destroy this, it just like make

43:52.520 --> 43:55.020
everything like crash into like multiple

43:55.020 --> 43:58.080
pieces and like make everything bad. So

43:58.080 --> 44:02.980
it's my home. It's where I live. So to see

44:02.980 --> 44:04.980
it kind of like crumble with all this

44:04.980 --> 44:07.380
pollution and all this plastic being

44:07.380 --> 44:12.100
littered, it really is sad. And what do

44:12.100 --> 44:13.900
you think of when you hear the term

44:13.900 --> 44:17.340
climate change? Climate change is like

44:17.340 --> 44:20.140
mainly human impact and what humans are

44:20.140 --> 44:23.440
doing to the environment, such as like

44:23.440 --> 44:26.360
burning fossil fuels. I mean, when I'm

44:26.360 --> 44:29.080
hearing climate change, I'm literally

44:29.080 --> 44:31.240
imagining a sun with like little

44:31.240 --> 44:33.420
sunglasses looking at the earth and

44:33.420 --> 44:34.760
getting closer and closer together.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.240
together then I think about icebergs and

44:37.240 --> 44:38.960
how they're melting and then the polar

44:38.960 --> 44:41.160
bears who are in those barren lands that

44:41.160 --> 44:42.760
don't have a lot of ice because all the

44:42.760 --> 44:45.260
icebergs are melting and then I start

44:45.260 --> 44:47.420
thinking of like greenhouses because of

44:47.420 --> 44:50.100
greenhouse gases and then I start thinking

44:50.100 --> 44:51.880
of cows because they produce the most

44:51.880 --> 44:54.460
greenhouse gases because methane and then

44:54.460 --> 44:57.060
I think of cars because pollution and

44:57.060 --> 44:59.200
there's all these things I start thinking

44:59.200 --> 45:02.480
of and then it just leads down to nothing.

45:03.600 --> 45:08.040
That's dark, but that's reality. It kind

45:08.040 --> 45:10.440
of makes me scared because like, if this

45:10.440 --> 45:13.580
problem just like, goes like further and

45:13.580 --> 45:16.720
further, I feel like I can't live in this

45:16.720 --> 45:18.460
environment right now. So I'm kind of

45:18.460 --> 45:21.360
scared right now. So and everyone's like

45:21.360 --> 45:23.340
talking, I'm going to unworry about it. So

45:23.340 --> 45:25.920
I'm like, kind of worried and scared every

45:25.920 --> 45:28.640
time I heard that word. Can you think of

45:28.640 --> 45:30.800
and describe to me a specific time when

45:30.800 --> 45:32.500
something that seemed related to climate

45:32.500 --> 45:35.280
change impacted your life? So in

45:35.280 --> 45:40.640
California recently, there have been some

45:40.640 --> 45:43.680
fires and pretty big ones, like really big

45:43.680 --> 45:47.760
wildfires. And that's due to how the

45:47.760 --> 45:52.840
increase of heat in our atmosphere. And it

45:52.840 --> 45:55.120
makes, if you have like dried out grass,

45:55.340 --> 45:57.100
it can maybe like start fires and it can

45:57.100 --> 46:00.060
destroy so much and contaminate people's

46:00.060 --> 46:03.320
homes. and it's really sad because it's

46:03.320 --> 46:07.880
really destructive. That was a really big

46:07.880 --> 46:10.120
moment to a lot of people. Something that

46:10.120 --> 46:12.580
really impacted me, one where there were

46:12.580 --> 46:15.240
the fires in North California because I

46:15.240 --> 46:18.100
remember at school, we would always smell

46:18.100 --> 46:21.680
smoke everywhere and then we had to have

46:21.680 --> 46:25.320
the power shut off and also something that

46:25.320 --> 46:28.840
didn't necessarily impact me, but I've

46:28.840 --> 46:31.880
heard a lot about the fires in Australia.

46:32.680 --> 46:35.620
And then so like, I really feel for like

46:35.620 --> 46:38.360
the people and the animals that had to go

46:38.360 --> 46:40.840
through that. Only when I got to Korea

46:40.840 --> 46:43.020
that far I feel like it affects me. Like I

46:43.020 --> 46:44.940
said, there's so much yellow dust going

46:44.940 --> 46:48.540
around. This is something about factories

46:48.540 --> 46:52.280
producing too much smoke and dust are

46:52.280 --> 46:55.520
blowing into Korea. Yeah, so we have to

46:55.520 --> 46:58.280
suffer because some factories are putting

46:58.280 --> 47:03.000
their smoke into our country. I think I

47:03.000 --> 47:06.240
hear a lot about what's kind of going on

47:06.240 --> 47:08.720
in the environmental field and

47:08.720 --> 47:11.320
specifically in the realm of climate

47:11.320 --> 47:14.920
change. And I've heard people become less

47:14.920 --> 47:20.480
and less optimistic over time. Just in

47:20.480 --> 47:21.240
general, yeah.

47:27.420 --> 47:29.720
For those of you that are just joining us,

47:29.840 --> 47:32.140
you are listening to the Happy Birthday

47:32.140 --> 47:35.680
Earth Day 50th Anniversary Special on KCSU

47:35.680 --> 47:40.960
Stanford 90.1. We just heard from 13

47:40.960 --> 47:42.780
middle school students about the ways in

47:42.780 --> 47:44.520
which climate change has influenced their

47:44.520 --> 47:46.460
lives. But what I found particularly

47:46.460 --> 47:48.640
striking about this conversation was how

47:48.640 --> 47:50.540
much the students were aware of not only

47:50.540 --> 47:52.900
climate change's impact on themselves, but

47:52.900 --> 47:55.820
also on their community at large. Yeah, I

47:55.820 --> 47:58.020
agree. They're picking up on so many

47:58.020 --> 48:00.880
nuanced and complex issues. It feels like

48:00.880 --> 48:03.000
adults sometimes underestimate young

48:03.000 --> 48:05.240
people and their ability to see the bigger

48:05.240 --> 48:08.320
picture. But hearing about how they see

48:08.320 --> 48:10.620
climate change has really shown me how

48:10.620 --> 48:13.400
incredibly perceptive and capable they

48:13.400 --> 48:17.960
really are. That's right, and I think it's

48:17.960 --> 48:20.100
super important to recognize because they

48:20.100 --> 48:21.760
will be shaping the future of our planet.

48:22.220 --> 48:23.680
Let's hear a little more from them about

48:23.680 --> 48:25.160
what they expect the world will look like

48:25.160 --> 48:27.060
at the 100th anniversary of Earth Day.

48:32.700 --> 48:35.280
As you know, this year is the 50th

48:35.280 --> 48:37.200
anniversary of Earth Day, and the

48:37.200 --> 48:39.200
environment has changed in a number of

48:39.200 --> 48:42.320
ways since that very first one. So let's

48:42.320 --> 48:45.300
imagine 50 years from now. Really take a

48:45.300 --> 48:47.660
minute to imagine that. You'll be just

48:47.660 --> 48:50.520
over 60 years old. You may have a partner,

48:50.700 --> 48:53.900
children of your own. You might be doctors

48:53.900 --> 48:57.520
and architects, environmentalists. Think

48:57.520 --> 48:59.320
about what the world might look like then.

48:59.960 --> 49:02.180
What can you imagine the environment will

49:02.180 --> 49:04.080
be like? What do you think will have

49:04.080 --> 49:06.300
changed and what will have stayed the

49:06.300 --> 49:10.780
same? our impact on the earth could go two

49:10.780 --> 49:14.320
ways one is that like if we continue this

49:14.320 --> 49:16.900
path that we're going in the earth will

49:16.900 --> 49:21.700
definitely like not thrive but however um

49:21.700 --> 49:24.720
if we make a bunch of little changes and

49:24.720 --> 49:27.700
we like change our lifestyle and how we

49:27.700 --> 49:32.900
live then the earth will definitely like

49:32.900 --> 49:36.520
like stay the same or even like go back to

49:36.520 --> 49:40.100
how like it was like years prior but like

49:40.100 --> 49:43.260
as I said before if like we continue this

49:43.260 --> 49:45.980
path that we're going through now like

49:45.980 --> 49:48.460
we're like burning so many fossil fuels

49:48.460 --> 49:51.720
and like driving everywhere and like um

49:51.720 --> 49:55.860
and like wasting so much food and and

49:55.860 --> 49:58.540
things and that will definitely drive the

49:58.540 --> 50:03.060
earth to like not um be how it is now and

50:03.060 --> 50:06.420
how it was before although i would like

50:06.420 --> 50:09.420
everyone to like make a change it doesn't

50:09.420 --> 50:12.340
seem like it's happening right now the

50:12.340 --> 50:14.240
thing that most looks most likely

50:14.240 --> 50:17.660
currently is that um it will continue

50:17.660 --> 50:21.580
moving in this path and the earth won't

50:21.580 --> 50:21.980
survive

50:24.980 --> 50:29.460
I feel like the grass isn't going to be as

50:29.460 --> 50:32.660
green technology is going to like take

50:32.660 --> 50:36.140
over I feel like now people are starting

50:36.140 --> 50:38.060
to figure out like more about the

50:38.060 --> 50:39.480
environment they're trying to help it more

50:39.480 --> 50:42.860
so I think that with more buildings and

50:42.860 --> 50:45.220
everything happening I think that people

50:45.220 --> 50:47.700
more people will start to like help out so

50:47.700 --> 50:50.700
we can have a good balance of both things

50:50.700 --> 50:53.640
and I think that if more and more people

50:53.640 --> 50:55.480
come together and try to help the

50:55.480 --> 50:57.480
environment we can make a big difference

50:57.480 --> 50:59.880
and in 50 years we can have helped the

50:59.880 --> 51:02.400
environment while still developing our

51:02.400 --> 51:06.020
economy but not like ruining the

51:06.020 --> 51:07.680
environment in a way. It would probably

51:07.680 --> 51:10.140
get worse before it gets better so

51:10.140 --> 51:12.040
probably there There would be higher sea

51:12.040 --> 51:14.160
levels. There would have been more fires,

51:14.160 --> 51:16.160
more deforestation, but then it will have

51:16.160 --> 51:18.640
started. Hopefully it will be better by

51:18.640 --> 51:21.420
then. There will be less plastic in the

51:21.420 --> 51:24.060
ocean. The temperatures will start going

51:24.060 --> 51:26.860
down. We'll stop burning so much fossil

51:26.860 --> 51:31.500
fuels. Probably once it starts actually

51:31.500 --> 51:34.460
affecting the people who have power to

51:34.460 --> 51:38.120
make the changes that will stop it getting

51:38.120 --> 51:39.960
worse, Once it actually starts affecting

51:39.960 --> 51:43.820
those people, then it will likely start

51:43.820 --> 51:45.640
getting better. Once it starts affecting

51:45.640 --> 51:47.100
the people who have power.

51:53.780 --> 51:55.900
It sounds to me like they are really aware

51:55.900 --> 51:57.880
of how decisions made right now will

51:57.880 --> 51:59.300
dramatically influence what the world

51:59.300 --> 52:01.600
looks like in the future. That we are at a

52:01.600 --> 52:03.320
turning point and that we need to have a

52:03.320 --> 52:06.480
plan of action. Definitely. So let's hear

52:06.480 --> 52:08.320
more about what they see as the biggest

52:08.320 --> 52:11.640
environmental threats and about how we can

52:11.640 --> 52:12.320
overcome them.

52:17.700 --> 52:19.700
Can you describe what you think is the

52:19.700 --> 52:21.560
most important environmental issue facing

52:21.560 --> 52:23.820
our society today, in your opinion, and

52:23.820 --> 52:27.400
why it's important? I find that global

52:27.400 --> 52:30.360
warming is a main problem, problem mainly

52:30.360 --> 52:33.300
because um the glaciers are melting um

52:33.300 --> 52:36.300
well if the glaciers melt um we'll

52:36.300 --> 52:38.860
probably all flooded like i said anything

52:38.860 --> 52:41.860
that um any diseases or anything really

52:41.860 --> 52:44.680
terrifying um is in the glacier might come

52:44.680 --> 52:46.820
out who knows what's in those glaciers we

52:46.820 --> 52:49.100
haven't explored them yet so if they do

52:49.100 --> 52:51.980
melt then um you'll make your jobs of

52:51.980 --> 52:54.300
finding what's in there easier in a bad

52:54.300 --> 52:59.940
way um i think that it's uh air pollution

52:59.940 --> 53:04.060
because like it's something that impacts

53:04.060 --> 53:06.060
every single one of us that are on this

53:06.060 --> 53:08.940
earth right now and it's been impacting us

53:08.940 --> 53:11.300
but i think it would grow and it wouldn't

53:11.300 --> 53:13.500
just impact some people it'd impact the

53:13.500 --> 53:18.100
world as a whole um i think like plastic

53:18.100 --> 53:20.140
and trash issues that are like one of the

53:20.140 --> 53:23.220
most hardest problems to fix or like

53:23.220 --> 53:24.780
problems that we're facing that is

53:24.780 --> 53:29.220
difficult because like recycling and like

53:29.220 --> 53:30.840
plastic and other stuff we can do

53:30.840 --> 53:32.820
something with it but people are not like

53:32.820 --> 53:35.540
maybe they're like trying but we're not

53:35.540 --> 53:38.540
we're not doing that well like a good job

53:38.540 --> 53:41.060
right now so I read an article about trash

53:41.060 --> 53:43.720
and there's like huge like mountains of

53:43.720 --> 53:46.640
trash and like near the ocean or the bay

53:46.640 --> 53:49.020
or something and like that's affecting our

53:49.020 --> 53:51.560
environment a lot and I got like really

53:51.560 --> 53:53.520
scared because like I didn't know about

53:53.520 --> 53:56.120
trash because I'm throwing in the trash

53:56.120 --> 53:59.440
and like if I see other people are doing

53:59.440 --> 54:02.880
like this I feel like oh maybe I need to

54:02.880 --> 54:05.940
do a better job or do something for to

54:05.940 --> 54:09.600
make them rethink about what how the trash

54:09.600 --> 54:11.820
and plastics are destroying the

54:11.820 --> 54:16.000
environment the amount of plastic that are

54:16.000 --> 54:18.900
is like in the world right now because

54:18.900 --> 54:24.120
plastic just well in order to make plastic

54:24.120 --> 54:27.000
you also like have to reduce a lot of

54:27.000 --> 54:29.720
chemicals into the atmosphere which

54:29.720 --> 54:32.060
worsens it and plastic can't be like

54:32.060 --> 54:35.800
broken down for a very long time and like

54:35.800 --> 54:38.500
it's going to take a lot of years so it

54:38.500 --> 54:40.700
just lays there in the ocean and

54:40.700 --> 54:46.300
eventually the ocean will just like be

54:46.300 --> 54:48.320
filled with a lot of plastic. It already

54:48.320 --> 54:51.880
is, but if it continues to be like this,

54:51.940 --> 54:54.400
it's going to like be made of plastic

54:54.400 --> 54:57.940
almost-ish. So really plastic is the main

54:57.940 --> 55:01.260
thing I'm focusing on because it comes in

55:01.260 --> 55:04.340
a lot of packages and so many people don't

55:04.340 --> 55:06.680
just like throw it on the floor, throw it

55:06.680 --> 55:09.160
at the beach. A lot of beaches you just

55:09.160 --> 55:10.980
see a little plastic, but at this beach I

55:10.980 --> 55:13.520
went to, it was just so much plastic.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.960
Actually walking on plastic, like that was

55:16.960 --> 55:21.880
a whole different story. Trash. Filling up

55:21.880 --> 55:24.580
our earth with landfills when, you know,

55:24.640 --> 55:27.440
space is finite. We're eventually going to

55:27.440 --> 55:30.580
run out. So I always just wonder what I'm

55:30.580 --> 55:33.680
going to do then, you know. Live on the

55:33.680 --> 55:37.660
same planet, right? We're killing it. You

55:37.660 --> 55:39.900
know, again, trash is bad for the

55:39.900 --> 55:42.780
environment. We have to destroy forests to

55:42.780 --> 55:45.380
make way for landfills. And obviously,

55:45.520 --> 55:47.120
another problem is with the more forests

55:47.120 --> 55:48.480
you destroy, the less oxygen we're

55:48.480 --> 55:50.280
getting. Because, you know, plants and

55:50.280 --> 55:53.580
trees transfer CO2 to oxygen. And, you

55:53.580 --> 55:57.460
know, we breathe oxygen. Now, walk me

55:57.460 --> 55:59.840
through an action that we can take to

55:59.840 --> 56:02.740
address some of those issues. choose um

56:02.740 --> 56:05.380
this may be like really simple and like

56:05.380 --> 56:08.220
people are taught to but like just like

56:08.220 --> 56:12.960
split or try not to use trash because if

56:12.960 --> 56:15.220
we use like recyclable water bottle or

56:15.220 --> 56:17.920
like container or stuff that like amount

56:17.920 --> 56:20.620
of plastic can be reduced like a lot well

56:20.620 --> 56:24.760
you can for sure reuse stuff that are

56:24.760 --> 56:28.340
plastic or even not. I've always, I like

56:28.340 --> 56:30.900
use public transportation a lot. And I

56:30.900 --> 56:33.980
think that like, like that's just a really

56:33.980 --> 56:36.860
easy way that we can help out use public

56:36.860 --> 56:39.080
transportation because not only is it

56:39.080 --> 56:40.380
going to help the environment, but like

56:40.380 --> 56:42.560
we've become so disconnected in this

56:42.560 --> 56:43.920
world. I feel like it could bring us

56:43.920 --> 56:46.300
together more. And also like the

56:46.300 --> 56:48.860
experiences that happen when you're with

56:48.860 --> 56:51.780
other people really shapes who you are. I

56:51.780 --> 56:54.980
feel like if we all planted more trees in

56:54.980 --> 56:57.120
our neighborhoods or in local parks, that

56:57.120 --> 57:00.440
would be really helpful. And if there's

57:00.440 --> 57:02.940
like any bills that could be passed, I'm

57:02.940 --> 57:04.500
sure there are a lot of proposed bills.

57:04.500 --> 57:07.980
and then honestly just reducing shower

57:07.980 --> 57:12.240
times and like just trying to use solar

57:12.240 --> 57:15.100
panels or like wind-powered things to just

57:15.100 --> 57:18.100
use less of like the electrical like fuels

57:18.100 --> 57:20.300
I feel like that would definitely be

57:20.300 --> 57:23.740
useful more hybrid cars and electric cars

57:23.740 --> 57:27.340
you just need to just like make people

57:27.340 --> 57:30.900
feel like it's important to save the

57:30.900 --> 57:32.720
environment I mean people love a good

57:32.720 --> 57:34.460
bargain so anything that That would help

57:34.460 --> 57:36.220
them save money, whether that's lowered

57:36.220 --> 57:37.920
tax rates because they have an electric

57:37.920 --> 57:41.840
car or if they get some sort of like tax

57:41.840 --> 57:45.180
refund because they planted a tree. I

57:45.180 --> 57:48.100
think that everyone can just take a bunch

57:48.100 --> 57:52.480
of like small steps towards the issue. For

57:52.480 --> 57:55.300
example, choosing to walk or bike or like

57:55.300 --> 57:59.200
scooter rather than driving somewhere and

57:59.200 --> 58:01.820
just being mindful of like everything that

58:01.820 --> 58:05.900
you do before you do it. So I know there's

58:05.900 --> 58:07.660
a lot to be worried about, and you may be

58:07.660 --> 58:09.460
feeling that especially right now with the

58:09.460 --> 58:12.020
coronavirus pandemic. But one thing that

58:12.020 --> 58:13.920
we're really interested in as people who

58:13.920 --> 58:15.740
work on environmental issues is what makes

58:15.740 --> 58:18.040
people hopeful, what makes people believe

58:18.040 --> 58:19.480
that there will be a better future ahead.

58:19.900 --> 58:22.260
So to that end, what makes you hopeful for

58:22.260 --> 58:23.860
the future of the environment and why?

58:25.800 --> 58:30.440
Honestly, because if you don't hope, then

58:30.440 --> 58:34.780
what is there to be? I mean, if you're not

58:34.780 --> 58:35.920
hoping that things are going to get

58:35.920 --> 58:37.160
better, things just aren't going to get

58:37.160 --> 58:38.540
better because you're not actively doing

58:38.540 --> 58:41.160
something against it. Even if it is just

58:41.160 --> 58:43.240
recycling, you're obviously hoping that

58:43.240 --> 58:46.480
you're going to make a difference. The

58:46.480 --> 58:49.780
little things that everyone does. The

58:49.780 --> 58:53.280
plants growing, even though we've had

58:53.280 --> 58:57.360
challenges and destruction in our earth,

58:57.500 --> 59:01.120
makes me hopeful. that they'll continue to

59:01.120 --> 59:06.280
keep growing for the next generations. How

59:06.280 --> 59:09.140
awareness has spread, as well as the

59:09.140 --> 59:12.320
younger generation has really seen the

59:12.320 --> 59:16.460
evolution of how the problem has been

59:16.460 --> 59:19.160
impacting us. So I think that we'd be more

59:19.160 --> 59:21.720
inspired and more driven to solve this

59:21.720 --> 59:23.700
problem. And I think that's what is really

59:23.700 --> 59:27.980
giving hope to me. electric cars in recent

59:27.980 --> 59:31.520
years have sort of boomed there's they

59:31.520 --> 59:33.580
went from being maybe like five or ten

59:33.580 --> 59:36.700
years ago like a handful that had a very

59:36.700 --> 59:39.220
short range and weren't very popular and

59:39.220 --> 59:42.300
now tons of brands are coming out with

59:42.300 --> 59:45.420
their electric cars and electric cars i'm

59:45.420 --> 59:47.260
seeing more and more of them on the street

59:47.260 --> 59:51.320
i mean i think people like elon musk who

59:51.320 --> 59:55.200
are working towards having a better or

59:55.200 --> 59:58.820
future for the earth. So he made Teslas,

59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.880
like electric cars, not sponsored. That

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.420
makes me really hopeful because I'm sure

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.060
there are all these people in colleges

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.840
right now who are trying to be the next

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.760
Elon Musk. I know that there will just be

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.320
more and more of those people, which means

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.700
more and more solutions to these giant

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.920
problems. That people are like releasing

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.860
these animals that have been injured by

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.980
plastic or oil. it makes me feel good that

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.720
people here still have a heart so it gives

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.580
me a little hope that maybe we can still

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.680
do it well right now schools are really

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.980
like teaching more about the problems and

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.220
that's better so the students will

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.660
probably like understand at least most of

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.400
them and they'll probably do something at

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.720
least to help the environment when there

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.180
used to be school well until all this

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.600
pandemic oh I would always bike around the

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.620
same time to school and near Goodwill I

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:01.500
would always see an like a lady more on

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:06.760
the old side and every single morning she

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.980
would wake up early and go and collect

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.080
trash around Goodwill like whenever I saw

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.500
her I would always say good good morning

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.100
and I was like I was so happy like when I

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.880
saw her because every single day she went

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.520
out it was hard sometimes it was raining

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.960
but she always collected at least a bag of

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.780
trash in the morning if I at least like

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.980
see someone trying to help an environment

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:32.880
it does like really make me like huge hope

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.700
that like oh there's at least some person

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.200
like one person that's helping the

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.360
environment if there's like more people

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.000
just like try to help the environment. I

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.300
think lots of people really think strongly

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.960
about this and if they all just keep

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.720
persisting maybe many others will also

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.960
contribute to these ideas and thoughts. I

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.100
see a lot of people coming together to do

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.680
the right thing that makes me hopeful

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.760
because it shows that people like do care

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.580
about our environment and they They want

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.880
us to live in the best place that we can,

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.460
and they're doing their part. And I think

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.680
that also when you see people doing their

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.340
part, it makes you want to do your part.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.780
And then it just like builds this

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.400
community of people doing the best that

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.180
they can to preserve everything they can.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.320
I know this happens to me all the time,

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.220
and it's kind of off topic. My grandma

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.980
loves to keep the sink on, like on dirty

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.000
dishes, and I always tell her to stop. And

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.060
even like little things like that are

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.640
helping the environment because it's not

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.440
wasting water. and when I do it it gives

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.920
me hope because I'm showing that I care

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.560
and that also gives me hope that more and

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.200
more people will start to do it and then

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.760
we can make an even bigger difference.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.180
Well every year I invite you a new edition

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.380
of a Times recap or something basically it

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.340
tells every single thing that happens last

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.660
year. I usually look back and try looking

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.160
at everything that happened during global

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.100
warming. Sometimes it will be bad, like, I

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.720
don't know. The one I'm reading right now

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.080
said that the glaciers have two giant

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.740
chunks have fallen off the glacier. So

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.620
that shows that's going closer to global

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.620
warming and is taking place. That part

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:24.060
kind of creeps me out. But also I found

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.700
other good news, like people in British

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.720
are actually now complaining about the

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.060
global warming. School students in high

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.900
school are taking part and started

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.960
rallying in the streets in 2019. I find

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.000
that more people are being more aware of

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.340
global warming. Actually, that itself

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.960
gives me hope that people are not trying

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.460
to take action and that some people are

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.100
standing up to the people who are actually

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:56.200
causing all this trouble. That part gives

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.180
me hope.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.420
It makes me hopeful that there's a whole

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.340
new generation. And if they grow up

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.100
hearing this message over and over, then

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.240
it will get wired into their brain. And

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.140
hopefully it'll become something they care

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.520
about. And I'll try really hard to help

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.960
our earth get better. I know it's

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.060
sometimes hard to imagine that young

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.440
people can make a difference, but being

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.240
creative, what do you think people your

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.820
age can do to help ensure that the world

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:33.380
will be better 5, 10, 15 years in the

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.160
future, especially when we're talking

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.780
about the environment? well we could just

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.280
talk small pick up trash that um people

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.800
like students from school have left and

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.540
threw away and on the floor pick it up and

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.540
tell them that you shouldn't do that small

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.580
things right um recycle don't mix up trash

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.840
with their cycle just honestly basic

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.300
research can go a long way right you know

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.600
what to recycle you're not going to put

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.540
trash in the recycle we should just go

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:09.240
waste right uh and then again just being

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.680
informed when you're a kid so you know

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.300
what to do when you're an adult right like

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.060
maybe when you're not when you're an adult

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.300
not all cars would be electric but you

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.040
obviously know the problem so maybe you

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.460
would lean towards an electric car if you

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:26.440
again can you know get one well they can

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.520
for sure like reuse plastic and like maybe

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.700
i think they can also So at least try to

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.580
buy less plastic in stores and stuff that

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.360
are bad for the environment. Like small

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.400
decisions and also like letting people,

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.320
telling people how they can help. Not if

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.780
you like, if you just do something, that's

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.240
one thing. But if you tell a bunch of

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.580
people that they should be doing it too,

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.700
then you can, then people can make like a

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.200
bigger impact. impact. Some things are

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.140
really necessary for us, but other things

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.320
are harming us like drugs. And that's

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.860
something that's become really like, it's

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:11.140
increasing in a worse way in my

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.260
generation. So I think that like, a way

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.420
that we could stop this is stop all

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.000
unnecessary things that aren't good for

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.620
the environment or good for us. And I

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.460
think that would not only help the

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.600
environment, but also the health our

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.600
overall health I feel like we can make

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.480
sure trash gets into the trash and not

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.200
around our planet I also feel like we can

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.380
start planting more plants making sure um

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.240
the whole community's environment is nice

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.480
um I think it's like it can be in like any

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.800
generations but like just to tell Tell

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.480
them what is going on right now and at

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.340
least one way to solve the problem that we

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:02.380
have about environmental issues. I feel

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.060
like I often mark those social media

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:08.300
reposts of this many forests are being cut

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.940
down in a second. But I feel like it

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.820
really is helpful because it raises

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.900
awareness. And I feel like raising

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.600
awareness in daily life is so important

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.060
because we don't spend our time watching

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.640
Greta Thunberg's speeches. I don't spend

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.380
my time doing that, at least. And I know

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:30.320
most of my friends don't. Kids my age or

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.680
any age could start maybe some clubs or

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.240
make a petition on how we should store our

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.440
trash. many like posters and clubs could

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:46.380
really affect the way people at schools

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:50.180
can think about the environment. Maybe

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.980
work at your school like see if what your

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.840
school is doing for like sustainable

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.780
energy if your school like does your

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.880
school have solar panels if there's like

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.580
room in their budget to install them you

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.580
could see if you could work with the

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.060
district to maybe install solar panels at

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.340
your school or have like see if you could

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.960
make the have the office install like

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.240
electric car charging spots in like the

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.040
parking lot at your school or something

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.800
like that now see if your school most

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.760
schools have like student government like

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.280
student council or something like that and

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.680
see if you could either be part of that or

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.340
work with someone or multiple people who

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.400
are part of that or see if there's like a

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.860
teacher who has like similar views and and

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.720
see if you could work with them? I think

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.340
the younger generations are who's on

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:45.680
social media the most. And so they're all

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.900
getting the message, but I think it's the

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.920
older generations that don't really get

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.200
the message. So I think the younger

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.540
generation should spread that knowledge.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.880
But I know that every single time, it's

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.700
annoying, but every single time before my

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.480
parents go out, I always remind them like

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.760
don't buy any plastic like do your best to

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.700
just buy metal and paper and whatever you

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.920
can to stop so we can stop using plastic

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.860
and even little differences that like we

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.700
can make like not using as much water or

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.000
even just telling our parents to not use

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.680
as much water will result in a bigger

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.780
difference and I know that sometimes it's

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:27.240
hard because like you're like it's not

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.780
that big but with more and more kids doing

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.920
it it will become something big and then

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.820
their parents result doing it and then

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.040
it'll just become a big thing of people

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.760
doing what they can to help. I know with

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.040
my family I think it would be more coming

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.620
from me because hearing that I want to

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.300
help change the world and change the

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.780
environment I think has an impact on them

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.100
because it shows that like what they're

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.380
doing matters to me and what I'm doing

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.840
matters to me. I just want to help the

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.720
environment the best I can and I think

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.860
that also like I know my parents don't

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.880
probably think that I think about these

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.480
kind of things. So I think that even

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.300
coming from someone younger is more

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.300
impactful because you're like, oh, even

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.940
though they're young, they're trying to

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.260
help the world and they're trying to make

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.440
a difference. Like you said, what gives me

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.500
hope was that people who are becoming

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.220
aware, for it to happen, I think that,

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.040
like you said, that more people should be

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.240
aware, not just the young generation, but

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.040
actually every generation should be more

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.260
aware of climate change and actually try

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.540
taking a step to stop it. And like I said,

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.900
even if it's small, it does count. So I

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.520
wish for it to change. I think that not

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.740
just our generation, but every generation

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.960
should step up and try slowing down

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960
climate change, even if it's small.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.420
Wow, it is so inspiring and encouraging to

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.300
hear this wide variety of solutions.

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.520
solutions. Not only did they explain what

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.100
younger people can do, but also how adults

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.020
and people of our generation can get

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:04.140
involved, in both large and small ways.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.980
That's right, and I think that the impact

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.560
of this is twofold. Not only are they

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.120
helping us all to act by providing

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.700
concrete actions we can take, I think they

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.900
are also inspiring us to take action. I

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.840
feel like we as a society always say that

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.820
we want to protect the earth for future

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:23.180
generations, but we don't really take the

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.240
time to involve our young people today and

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.740
what they can do here and now. Children

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.880
have always been a powerful motivator for

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.320
environmental action. I think seeing kids

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.780
who are striving to lead environmentally

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.960
conscious lives can show us all what a

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.800
more sustainable future could look like.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.400
As Greta Thunberg said, people feel very

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.820
guilty when a child says, you are stealing

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:47.320
my future. That has impact. impact. We're

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.960
used to making decisions with kids in

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.040
mind, but I don't think we're used to

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.040
making decisions with kids in the room.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.460
Yeah, we need to make sure that we

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.360
continue involving kids in conversations

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.920
about the environment and creating

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.100
platforms for them to share their ideas.

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.320
They cannot participate in the

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.060
environmental movement at the ballot box,

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.240
but their ideas can be incorporated if

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.400
voters are willing to listen. And climate

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.360
change is also an inherently inherently

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.000
intergenerational issue. And I believe

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.500
that we will be in very capable hands when

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.940
these kids are one day making the

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.860
decisions. I also personally feel

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.780
incredibly inspired by these kids and

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.160
their messages of hope. In college, as

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.960
environmental science majors, I feel like

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.860
we are constantly bombarded with reminders

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:31.640
of how big and complex environmental

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.720
issues are, and that can become really

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.620
discouraging over time. Exactly, and

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.460
that's why we love talking to people about

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.000
their their ideas, and their hopes,

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.520
especially with younger people who will

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.140
soon be at the helm of the environmental

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.520
movement. It is rejuvenating to palpably

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.520
feel so much hope and optimism, and it

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.340
serves as a powerful motivator for us as

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:58.020
we continue on our own paths. Well, in

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.060
closing, we just want to express our

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.800
appreciation for all of the people who

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.000
have supported us in this project. It has

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.800
been an incredibly long journey, and we

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.500
are so grateful to have had such a

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.840
wonderful team. Yes, thank you to our 13

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.960
student participants, their adult

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.320
interviewees, our mentors at Stanford,

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.920
Richard and Nicole, and the teachers and

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.700
parents from Ellen Fletcher Middle School,

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.280
all of whom made this program possible.

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.480
And thanks to you, the listeners, for

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.040
spending your Earth Day here with us.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.140
We'll leave you with one last coronavirus

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.660
message on behalf of KZSU, but please stay

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.980
safe and have a great rest of your

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.540
evening. name. With many schools closed

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.100
due to the COVID-19 crisis, kids are

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.100
missing meals daily. No Kid Hungry is

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.760
stepping up. They're using donations,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.360
large and small, to grant funding to

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.200
school districts, food banks, and other

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.560
local organizations right here in the Bay

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.600
Area, which in turn are feeding kids. No

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.800
Kid Hungry is dedicated to working year

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.600
-round to help the one in seven kids

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.300
across across the U.S. who face hunger

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.340
every day. To donate, visit nokidhungry

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:31.780
Thank you.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.500
Thank you.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:29.540
Thank you.
