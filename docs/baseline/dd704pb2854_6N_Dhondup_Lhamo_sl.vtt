and appreciate very much your

02:14.740 --> 02:16.000

02:21.740 --> 02:23.520
How old are you?

02:27.200 --> 02:27.880
71.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.540
And where are you from in Tibet?

02:36.360 --> 02:43.760
So the place

02:43.760 --> 02:48.380
where I lived was called La Gong. And in

02:48.380 --> 02:50.020
which province was La Gong?

03:04.660 --> 03:10.660
I came to Lhasa in 1961-62 when the

03:10.660 --> 03:12.760
Chinese created a lot of problems.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.080
Where were you born? In which province?

03:36.980 --> 03:40.900
So when you came to Lhasa, you were about

03:40.900 --> 03:41.540
how old?

03:57.960 --> 04:02.120
So I must have been about 36 years old and

04:02.120 --> 04:04.840
when I came to Lhasa I had three children

04:04.840 --> 04:07.820
with me and then three were born in Lhasa.

04:07.820 --> 04:08.560
Okay.

04:10.820 --> 04:15.660
So that's been so long ago. In your

04:15.660 --> 04:18.780
village, what did your father do? When we

04:18.780 --> 04:23.040
ourselves were Jon. We thought to eat it

04:23.040 --> 04:25.140
with a spoon. And we ate the soup with

04:25.140 --> 04:28.240
that spoon. On that day, the children

04:28.240 --> 04:33.840
made, a pot of tea Agricca, which they ate

04:33.840 --> 04:36.620
with fish. It burned in the bath. What did

04:36.620 --> 04:38.600
they eat with that? They ate with that

04:38.600 --> 04:44.180
masks, and put it on the ground, and put

04:44.180 --> 04:46.180
it into the buddy egg, because they ate

04:46.180 --> 04:50.900
with it, So in those days my father was a

04:50.900 --> 04:54.020
farmer working in the commune and then we

04:54.020 --> 04:58.340
would dig up medicinal plants called poppy

04:58.340 --> 05:04.420
from the ground. So you were in a commune,

05:04.420 --> 05:06.720
a Tibetan commune, or was this a Chinese

05:06.720 --> 05:11.480
commune? How decrease power the body and

05:11.480 --> 05:15.480
mind So clearly the mind and heart is

05:15.480 --> 05:16.260
different So when V peak can conclude that

05:16.260 --> 05:22.420
After all everything is good This equally

05:22.420 --> 05:30.500
increase the way of life Know that can

05:30.500 --> 05:37.480
know that That was good Their mind

05:48.460 --> 05:52.140
So it was a Tibetan commune run by

05:52.140 --> 05:56.660
Chinese, and when the farmers harvested

05:56.660 --> 06:00.440
grains and wheat and barley, we would have

06:00.440 --> 06:03.220
to give them to the Chinese. So being

06:03.220 --> 06:05.900
unable to endure the suffering, my husband

06:05.900 --> 06:09.320
and I and children fled. went to Lhasa.

06:09.500 --> 06:14.520
Went to Lhasa, right. So what memories do

06:14.520 --> 06:16.920
you have of your childhood when you were a

06:16.920 --> 06:17.440
little girl?

06:28.780 --> 06:33.360
What should I say

06:33.360 --> 06:34.260
about when I was little?

06:46.440 --> 06:50.920
I have no memories of my younger days.

06:51.640 --> 06:56.900
What did your mother do? Are the Evökan

06:56.900 --> 06:58.240
people, who lived during Ruanduna

06:58.240 --> 07:01.680
boundaries and years old? Yes, some of

07:01.680 --> 07:06.300
them, who were born in theisk of the

07:06.300 --> 07:07.420
Pekdaya people, Por accounting for their

07:07.420 --> 07:10.920
responsabilies in the past, After the old

07:10.920 --> 07:12.600
age, the families came back to work to pay

07:12.600 --> 07:15.000
our rent,

07:29.840 --> 07:41.220
So in the

07:41.220 --> 07:44.480
commune, she was, she had the task of

07:44.480 --> 07:48.400
milking, and then also carrying hay on the

07:48.400 --> 07:51.500
back to be spread under the horses and

07:51.500 --> 07:54.960
mules. And then after we escaped, I had no

07:54.960 --> 07:59.140
idea about them, but I think they have all

07:59.140 --> 08:03.300
passed away now. So did you help your

08:03.300 --> 08:05.420
mother or your father with their work on

08:05.420 --> 08:09.720
the commune? Yes. When did you start

08:09.720 --> 08:12.360
working on the commune?

08:25.880 --> 08:26.480
No,

08:30.120 --> 08:33.000
because I had little children then, and so

08:33.000 --> 08:35.180
instead of helping them, I needed their

08:35.180 --> 08:35.660
help.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.740
How old were you when you had your first

08:40.740 --> 08:44.280
child? Amala, puku tangbo dikye di

08:44.280 --> 08:48.260
lokhajire? Puku tangbo shere la. Takonjo

08:48.260 --> 08:50.300
shere lokhajire. Nga zon de de lokhajire.

08:50.820 --> 09:05.880
Nga zon de de lokhajire. So we

09:05.880 --> 09:09.060
don't normally calculate our years and

09:09.060 --> 09:11.960
ages. So it was like, you know, animals

09:11.960 --> 09:14.780
giving birth. Likewise, we too gave birth

09:14.780 --> 09:18.960
to our children. Do your children live

09:18.960 --> 09:19.500
with you now?

09:26.940 --> 09:31.280
No, not together. I have three children,

09:31.400 --> 09:35.100
and I had my children in the hospital. Can

09:35.100 --> 09:37.620
you tell us about your experiences giving

09:37.620 --> 09:41.140
birth to children? So, Marwa, you are a

09:41.140 --> 09:43.760
very good teacher. You have taught us a

09:43.760 --> 09:47.180
lot of things. So, what do you think about

09:47.180 --> 09:50.840
teaching us how to be a good teacher? I

09:50.840 --> 09:53.820
don't know how to teach. I have been

09:53.820 --> 09:56.760
teaching since I was a child. I have been

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
teaching since I was a child. I don't know

09:58.760 --> 10:02.720
how to teach. I don't know how to teach. I

10:02.720 --> 10:04.660
don't know how to teach. I don't know how

10:04.660 --> 10:05.000
to teach.

10:14.620 --> 10:20.880
So I didn't give

10:20.880 --> 10:26.060
birth

10:26.060 --> 10:29.460
in hospitals and it was my husband that

10:29.460 --> 10:34.940
helped me during the childbirth. and it

10:34.940 --> 10:38.320
is only my daughter that was born in

10:38.320 --> 10:40.740
hospital and I couldn't give birth to her

10:40.740 --> 10:43.220
and all my other children including the

10:43.220 --> 10:47.660
twins were not born in hospital. How did

10:47.660 --> 10:48.740
your husband help you?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.940
I was a little girl, and I was a little

11:02.940 --> 11:07.000
girl. I was a little girl, and I was a

11:07.000 --> 11:10.140
little girl. I was a little girl, and I

11:10.140 --> 11:11.280
was a little girl. I was a little girl,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.540
and I was a little girl. I was a little

11:13.540 --> 11:17.380
girl, and I was a little girl. I was a

11:17.380 --> 11:20.680
little girl, and I was a little girl. I

11:20.680 --> 11:21.500
was a little girl, and I was a little

11:21.500 --> 11:21.780
girl.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.720
So when the first of the twins was born, I

11:44.720 --> 11:48.480
was on my knees and my husband, he took

11:48.480 --> 11:50.780
the child wrapped it in cloth and laid it

11:50.780 --> 11:54.220
on the bed and then I went out to answer

11:54.220 --> 11:57.140
nature's call and then I could feel that

11:57.140 --> 12:00.900
there was another child in me and so I

12:00.900 --> 12:03.800
told my husband that there is one more

12:03.800 --> 12:07.040
child and he said it can't be but then I

12:07.040 --> 12:09.420
said there is one more and then the other

12:09.420 --> 12:12.720
one was born and while breastfeeding I had

12:12.720 --> 12:15.440
to feed one child here and one child here

12:15.440 --> 12:17.900
and it was same when I was feeding them

12:17.900 --> 12:21.540
food later. At the same time, feeding them

12:21.540 --> 12:23.740
one here, one here? At the same time.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.020
Thujujjipa le chikla omadetje, chikla

12:26.020 --> 12:29.200
omadetje, roa? Nyaka tew. Nyaka ngode.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.620
Ngode nyaka sumte omadetje. Yes, because

12:32.620 --> 12:35.360
both cried at the same time. Cried, cried.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.760
And were all your children healthy when

12:38.760 --> 12:41.200
they were born? Amla, puku ketiw ka ne

12:41.200 --> 12:42.480
puku tsangma tangpo duwe?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.600
Khunpa kept on watching the holy ones also

12:47.600 --> 12:52.180
when he was praying, but the ladiesarmy

12:52.180 --> 12:53.740
joining them also didn't want him

12:53.740 --> 12:54.240
anything.

12:58.860 --> 13:02.060
Khunpa kept on watching and touching theتي

13:02.060 --> 13:02.240
places.

13:14.880 --> 13:20.120
So the second of the twins was born leg

13:20.120 --> 13:23.300
first, and I thought it was a headless

13:23.300 --> 13:27.120
child. And then my husband pulled it out,

13:27.220 --> 13:30.220
and there was no crying, so I thought it

13:30.220 --> 13:32.640
wasn't alive. and when I touched the leg

13:32.640 --> 13:35.300
it was warm and then my husband cleaned it

13:35.300 --> 13:39.820
up. How did you feel? Can you remember

13:39.820 --> 13:40.720
your emotions?

14:00.820 --> 14:04.820
I was very young. I was very young.

14:06.780 --> 14:10.900
I was very young. I was very young. I was

14:10.900 --> 14:13.260
very young. I was very young. I was very

14:13.260 --> 14:15.040
young. I was very young. I was very young.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.380
I was very young. I was very young. I was

14:18.380 --> 14:19.580
very young.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.200
I was very young.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.980
So the twins, you know, if one child got

14:38.980 --> 14:41.400
sick around 12 o'clock, the other would

14:41.400 --> 14:45.080
become sick at 3 p.m. So both had to be

14:45.080 --> 14:48.000
carried to the hospital in Pasa, and it

14:48.000 --> 14:50.040
was very difficult. And then later my

14:50.040 --> 14:52.660
husband found work at a construction site,

14:52.660 --> 14:57.020
and I could also find work but I couldn't

14:57.020 --> 15:01.180
do much as I was sick most of the time. So

15:01.180 --> 15:03.360
when you were sick, who took care of your

15:03.360 --> 15:03.800
children?

15:22.660 --> 15:24.660
There wasn't anyone else to take care of

15:24.660 --> 15:27.280
them. I had to, and then when my husband

15:27.280 --> 15:29.760
returned from work, then we took care of

15:29.760 --> 15:33.120
them together. Right. So when you lived in

15:33.120 --> 15:37.360
Lhasa, did you have family who also lived

15:37.360 --> 15:40.700
in Lhasa or lived near you? We didn't have

15:40.700 --> 15:43.980
any relatives. We didn't have any

15:43.980 --> 15:46.200
relatives. We didn't have any relatives.

15:46.300 --> 15:50.460
We didn't have any relatives. No, both of

15:50.460 --> 15:52.980
us didn't have any relatives. it is. So

15:52.980 --> 15:58.580
you said that you went to Lhasa and you

15:58.580 --> 16:02.420
had three children. What made your family

16:02.420 --> 16:03.260
go to Lhasa?

16:44.560 --> 16:49.140
So we had to leave our hometown because we

16:49.140 --> 16:51.680
couldn't survive there. there, there was

16:51.680 --> 16:54.660
lack of food because if you couldn't work

16:54.660 --> 16:57.740
hard, there was no grains for you, and

16:57.740 --> 17:00.960
then since we had many children, both of

17:00.960 --> 17:04.200
us couldn't survive there and that's why

17:04.200 --> 17:06.680
my husband suggested that we go to Lhasa.

17:08.060 --> 17:12.460
Why wasn't there enough food? And Magali,

17:12.580 --> 17:16.960
how do you do the work? We do it by hand.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.140
We do it by hand. We do it by hand. We do

17:25.140 --> 17:27.620
it by hand. We do it by hand.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.860
So in the commune system, you know, if you

17:39.860 --> 17:44.220
could work, the officials gave you marks,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.940
and if you didn't, you know, there was no

17:46.940 --> 17:48.940
marks, which meant that you got no grains.

17:50.680 --> 17:56.360
But you worked, didn't you? Did you eat

17:56.360 --> 17:56.420
anything?

18:01.880 --> 18:02.920
We did,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.720
but there was nothing to eat, so we left.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.640
Was it because you had so many children

18:12.640 --> 18:14.560
that what you were allowed, what you were

18:14.560 --> 18:15.700
allocated wasn't enough?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.600
bombalo I was able to get a lot of money

18:32.600 --> 18:36.160
from the government. I was able to get a

18:36.160 --> 18:38.080
lot of money from the government. I was

18:38.080 --> 18:41.420
able to get a lot of money from the

18:41.420 --> 18:43.340
government. Yeah,

18:48.640 --> 18:51.720
the allocation wasn't sufficient. And then

18:51.720 --> 18:54.420
when we were in Lhasa, a friend of my

18:54.420 --> 18:58.220
husband suggested that, that since we had

18:58.220 --> 19:01.680
many children, that if we went to Nepal,

19:01.860 --> 19:03.280
it would be a better life for the

19:03.280 --> 19:06.240
children. So that's why we came to Nepal.

19:08.100 --> 19:11.880
Right. We'll come back to Nepal in a

19:11.880 --> 19:14.620
minute, but I was wondering in what ways

19:14.620 --> 19:19.220
was life in Lhasa different from life in

19:19.220 --> 19:20.120
the village?

19:25.960 --> 19:26.660
The

20:28.560 --> 20:32.520
So it was better in Lhasa because my

20:32.520 --> 20:34.880
husband was engaged in the construction

20:34.880 --> 20:37.780
work and then friends and other people,

20:37.880 --> 20:39.880
they used to give us little bags of

20:39.880 --> 20:43.340
Sambar. Were there other ways in which

20:43.340 --> 20:45.240
your life in Lhasa was different from the

20:45.240 --> 20:48.480
village? You had more food, but were there

20:48.480 --> 20:49.860
other ways in which your life was

20:49.860 --> 20:50.260
different?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.680
I don't know, I can't say.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.220
So I have only so much to say. Right. So

21:13.220 --> 21:17.800
your family decided to come to Nepal. Can

21:17.800 --> 21:20.900
you tell us the story of coming to Nepal?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.380
But this new heart's embedded in her

21:49.380 --> 21:57.880
stomach and made of bamboo. and she

21:57.880 --> 22:04.300
was anywhere from 58

22:04.300 --> 22:08.660
to

22:08.660 --> 22:14.140
900 years old. It was a land state of five

22:14.140 --> 22:14.140
countries,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.120
added

23:06.560 --> 23:10.760
So from Lhasa there were times when we

23:10.760 --> 23:14.360
were on foot, and at times for an hour or

23:14.360 --> 23:17.300
two we would ply by vehicles but since we

23:17.300 --> 23:20.500
didn't have money to pay we couldn't get

23:20.500 --> 23:23.940
vehicles right through and it was from the

23:23.940 --> 23:27.340
border area of Tengri and Tamo that we

23:27.340 --> 23:31.780
came to Nepal and we were with quite a

23:31.780 --> 23:34.260
number of little children and my husband

23:34.260 --> 23:37.920
was carrying one of the twins over his his

23:37.920 --> 23:40.660
neck and the oldest son was carrying one

23:40.660 --> 23:44.920
of the other twins and the pathway was

23:44.920 --> 23:47.500
filled with snow and there were some

23:47.500 --> 23:49.920
Chinese people along the way that stopped

23:49.920 --> 23:52.580
us but since we were with little children

23:52.580 --> 23:55.500
they allowed us to go and in fact there

23:55.500 --> 23:58.060
were two girls that commented that the

23:58.060 --> 24:01.400
twins were very beautiful and then thanks

24:01.400 --> 24:03.640
thanks to the grace of his holiness we

24:03.640 --> 24:07.920
were able to escape safely How long did it

24:07.920 --> 24:10.920
take you to come from Lhasa to Nepal?

24:30.880 --> 24:34.120
So it might have taken about half a month,

24:34.300 --> 24:36.760
because at times we were walking and at

24:36.760 --> 24:39.280
times we could get lift in some vehicles.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.440
So what did you take with you when you

24:42.440 --> 24:43.500
left Tibet?

25:20.040 --> 25:23.540
So we had brought nothing except our

25:23.540 --> 25:27.440
blankets and a little bit of Tsampa. And

25:27.440 --> 25:30.580
when we reached Nepal, my husband had

25:30.580 --> 25:33.300
friends to whom we sent message, and they

25:33.300 --> 25:36.120
came to fetch us at the reception

25:36.120 --> 25:40.700
committee office. And did you have enough

25:40.700 --> 25:43.840
food, enough sampa, for your whole family

25:43.840 --> 25:45.620
to go for these two weeks?

26:09.600 --> 26:13.480
There was 200,000 Royal doctor! The police

26:13.480 --> 26:16.720
need to come immediately The police has

26:16.720 --> 26:17.780
come and arrested a woman I leave her ...

26:19.860 --> 26:22.720
She is bedridden I need to take her to the

26:22.720 --> 26:34.580
police Pleasechen But I do not want toatar

26:34.580 --> 26:36.360
I was a little girl, and I was a little

26:36.360 --> 26:39.380
girl. I was a little girl, and I was a

26:39.380 --> 26:43.380
little girl. I was a little girl, and I

26:43.380 --> 26:46.460
was a little girl. I was a little girl,

26:46.820 --> 26:49.860
and I was a little girl. I was a little

26:49.860 --> 26:50.840
girl, and I was a little girl. I was a

26:50.840 --> 26:51.300
little girl, and I was a little girl. I

26:51.300 --> 26:53.160
was a little girl, and I was a little

26:53.160 --> 26:56.640
girl. I was a little girl, and I was a

26:56.640 --> 26:59.620
little girl. I was a little girl, and I

26:59.620 --> 27:02.360
was a little girl.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.300
So we had, yes, a little bit of tsampa,

27:28.520 --> 27:30.780
and I used to feed the children in

27:30.780 --> 27:33.700
spoonfuls, which they used to gulp and

27:33.700 --> 27:37.000
then we were able to you know cross over a

27:37.000 --> 27:39.560
mountain and there was a river and nearby

27:39.560 --> 27:42.860
we found some Nepalese police and we were

27:42.860 --> 27:46.600
really very scared and I told my husband

27:46.600 --> 27:49.580
you know will they not kill us now and

27:49.580 --> 27:52.500
then we met some merchants who said that

27:52.500 --> 27:55.280
now you need have no fear because you will

27:55.280 --> 27:58.160
you are in Nepalese territory and you will

27:58.160 --> 28:01.000
no longer fall into Chinese hands But

28:01.000 --> 28:04.660
still they were very scared. And then we

28:04.660 --> 28:09.080
saw some Nepali road crew and they were

28:09.080 --> 28:13.520
living in little tents. And so we entered

28:13.520 --> 28:15.560
one of the tents and they gave us hot

28:15.560 --> 28:20.480
water and I made little balls of dough

28:20.480 --> 28:23.120
with the Sampa and hot water and fed my

28:23.120 --> 28:26.280
children. And then we went to Dharamsala

28:26.280 --> 28:28.800
and we were very happy to see His Holiness

28:28.800 --> 28:35.840
the Dalai So you arrived in Nepal and then

28:35.840 --> 28:38.780
how did you get to Dharamsala?

28:48.240 --> 28:53.080
The reception committee there dropped us

28:53.080 --> 28:57.740
to Dharamsala. I want to go back to make

28:57.740 --> 29:00.460
sure I've understood something. So your

29:00.460 --> 29:03.940
decision to leave Nepal, I mean to leave

29:03.940 --> 29:08.280
Tibet, was because of hunger? What was the

29:08.280 --> 29:10.400
reason why you left Tibet? Tibet.

29:59.360 --> 30:03.720
So the reason

30:03.720 --> 30:07.320
why we left our hometown forvariy was the

30:07.320 --> 30:10.800
lack of food and livelihood and hasa was

30:10.800 --> 30:14.320
better and then in the hometown but Our

30:14.320 --> 30:16.760
children were not getting any education in

30:16.760 --> 30:19.480
hasa so and we were told that if we went

30:19.480 --> 30:22.020
to Nepal We would be able to admit our

30:22.020 --> 30:24.460
children into school. So for the sake of

30:24.460 --> 30:29.840
our children So you

30:29.840 --> 30:34.420
lived in Tibet when the Chinese were there

30:34.420 --> 30:37.720
How is life like for you under the

30:37.720 --> 30:38.040
Chinese?

31:04.420 --> 31:07.840
So I do not have much knowledge. That's

31:07.840 --> 31:11.080
between in the offices, that happens, and

31:11.080 --> 31:15.820
my job was just doing my work. And your

31:15.820 --> 31:17.820
work was what? What was your work?

31:41.580 --> 31:46.460
So our responsibility was harvesting the

31:46.460 --> 31:51.520
parni and then de-husking them in a large

31:51.520 --> 31:55.300
open ground during the commune, but I have

31:55.300 --> 31:58.280
forgotten much of it. What about in Lhasa?

31:58.440 --> 32:05.440
What was your work in Lhasa? So, it's

32:05.440 --> 32:26.740
like

32:26.740 --> 32:28.160
what I told you earlier, here,

32:28.220 --> 32:31.040
constructing houses, digging the ground,

32:31.260 --> 32:33.740
laying the bricks, and building as it

32:33.740 --> 32:37.140
happens here. You did that? Amla adina la

32:37.140 --> 32:39.300
lera chey na, kama basura dwe adina la?

32:39.680 --> 32:43.340
Nga lera ka zote me na, nade. Lera ka zote

32:43.340 --> 32:47.120
me. No, I couldn't go to work because I

32:47.120 --> 32:53.000
was sick. Right. Okay. Did you have any

32:53.000 --> 32:55.920
interactions with Chinese people?

33:05.920 --> 33:06.640
No.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.660
So did life change for you when the

33:12.660 --> 33:14.920
Chinese came to Tibet?

33:20.520 --> 33:21.920
Yes,

33:43.780 --> 33:49.000
in In 1961-62, by then the Chinese had

33:49.000 --> 33:51.900
already launched the liberation. And at

33:51.900 --> 33:54.160
that time, when my husband and I escaped,

33:55.200 --> 33:59.580
there wasn't many people escaping then,

33:59.800 --> 34:02.520
but later on, more and more people started

34:02.520 --> 34:09.160
coming. And what happened then? We were in

34:09.160 --> 34:12.860
the same house. You mean the same house?

34:12.920 --> 34:13.140
No.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.120
Once we were at the reception center here

34:40.120 --> 34:42.920
and then we were sent to see His Holiness

34:42.920 --> 34:45.360
the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala and then the

34:45.360 --> 34:47.640
children were put in school and then my

34:47.640 --> 34:50.700
husband and I we were sent to a factory in

34:50.700 --> 34:53.740
Dalahousey in Himachal Pradesh and then

34:53.740 --> 34:56.460
there was no problem at all. Was your

34:56.460 --> 34:58.980
husband affected at all by the Chinese

34:58.980 --> 34:59.500
occupation?

35:12.920 --> 35:15.160
he starts to crochet some 다른loeWhen he

35:15.160 --> 35:29.940
designing this Let me see that's the

35:29.940 --> 35:42.000
kurva

35:42.000 --> 35:47.420
worker in Pasar and he was you know laying

35:47.420 --> 35:50.040
the iron rods for the construction and

35:50.040 --> 35:52.960
then after coming into India then he

35:52.960 --> 35:57.060
worked as a embosser of handmade carpets.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.180
Right at the beginning you mentioned that

36:01.180 --> 36:04.420
most of your children except for your last

36:04.420 --> 36:08.580
child were born at home but one child was

36:08.580 --> 36:11.720
born in the hospital. Why was that child

36:11.720 --> 36:13.600
born in the hospital? What caused you to

36:13.600 --> 36:15.400
take that, you know, go to the hospital

36:15.400 --> 36:15.840
for that?

36:40.240 --> 36:43.960
So I was having labor pains but could not

36:43.960 --> 36:46.420
give birth so that's why I went to the

36:46.420 --> 36:50.100
hospital. And your baby was safe? Now you

36:50.100 --> 36:51.220
know you have to carry on the

36:51.220 --> 36:53.220
discipleship. Yes. We are going to keep

36:53.220 --> 36:57.220
going because we are already deeply in

36:57.220 --> 36:57.220
love with you.

37:00.840 --> 37:07.060
Just in time, I will be if I have the

37:07.060 --> 37:10.540
sense of you coming into housing, as you

37:10.540 --> 37:11.060
can see

37:35.800 --> 37:38.340
Yes, the last child was born in hospital

37:38.340 --> 37:42.460
after five or six days. actually the labor

37:42.460 --> 37:45.420
pains had started and the child wasn't

37:45.420 --> 37:48.440
born so the nurse told me that I would

37:48.440 --> 37:50.420
have to stay in hospital for a few days

37:50.420 --> 37:53.020
because it was a big child but I didn't

37:53.020 --> 37:55.600
want to stay and wanted to go back home

37:55.600 --> 37:59.100
and my husband said that you know I

37:59.100 --> 38:01.560
wouldn't take me home saying that you know

38:01.560 --> 38:04.200
if we went back home that child and I

38:04.200 --> 38:08.900
would die. Is there anything else that you

38:08.900 --> 38:10.640
would like to share with us about your

38:10.640 --> 38:13.120
life in Tibet? .

38:18.060 --> 38:19.160
That's about it.

38:22.260 --> 38:27.580
Thank you. If this interview were shown in

38:27.580 --> 38:30.320
Tibet or China, would it be a problem for

38:30.320 --> 38:32.280
you? .

38:42.840 --> 38:48.680
I don't know

38:48.680 --> 38:51.400
whether there will be any problems or no

38:51.400 --> 38:54.200
problems. Is it okay if we use your real

38:54.200 --> 38:58.460
name? I think that's a good thing. I think

38:58.460 --> 39:00.980
that's a good thing. I think that's a good

39:00.980 --> 39:05.380
thing. Yes, it is. If I had a child, I

39:05.380 --> 39:10.700
would have a child. Yes, but then if the

39:10.700 --> 39:12.700
Chinese come and investigate, they may

39:12.700 --> 39:16.080
take me away. Thank you very much for

39:16.080 --> 39:17.500
sharing your story with us.
