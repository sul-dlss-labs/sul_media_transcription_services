and appreciate very much your

02:14.740 --> 02:16.000
participation in the project.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.520
How old are you?

02:27.200 --> 02:27.880
71.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.540
And where are you from in Tibet?

02:36.360 --> 02:43.760
So the place

02:43.760 --> 02:48.380
where I lived was called La Gong. And in

02:48.380 --> 02:50.020
which province was La Gong?

03:04.660 --> 03:10.660
I came to Lhasa in 1961-62 when the

03:10.660 --> 03:12.760
Chinese created a lot of problems.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.080
Where were you born? In which province?

03:36.980 --> 03:40.900
So when you came to Lhasa, you were about

03:40.900 --> 03:41.540
how old?

03:57.960 --> 04:02.120
So I must have been about 36 years old and

04:02.120 --> 04:04.840
when I came to Lhasa I had three children

04:04.840 --> 04:07.820
with me and then three were born in Lhasa.

04:07.820 --> 04:08.560
Okay.

04:10.820 --> 04:15.660
So that's been so long ago. In your

04:15.660 --> 04:18.900
village, what did your father do? Ms

04:18.900 --> 04:22.280
Naganga, are there

04:22.280 --> 04:24.820
conditions under the union or what offers

04:24.820 --> 04:30.840
you? No, people don't seeued more as a

04:30.840 --> 04:34.200
woman Or audio-visual people don't see it

04:34.200 --> 04:34.640
anymore

04:46.480 --> 04:51.320
So in those days my father was a farmer

04:51.320 --> 04:54.480
working in the commune and then we would

04:54.480 --> 04:59.120
dig up medicinal plants called poppy from

04:59.120 --> 04:59.700
the ground.

05:02.540 --> 05:04.820
So you were in a commune, a Tibetan

05:04.820 --> 05:08.100
commune, or was this a Chinese commune? Do

05:08.100 --> 05:11.960
you killsBL animals? Do you kill deer and

05:11.960 --> 05:15.800
wild animals? No No tighter put together

05:15.800 --> 05:26.140
if not put together re-decl

05:26.140 --> 05:32.820
ministre

05:32.820 --> 05:35.420
Then they would go to the fields and pick

05:35.420 --> 05:38.300
the seeds. And then they would go to the

05:38.300 --> 05:40.620
fields and pick the seeds. And then they

05:40.620 --> 05:42.960
would go to the fields and pick the seeds.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.120
So it was a Tibetan commune run by

05:52.120 --> 05:55.900
Chinese. And the farmers harvested, when

05:55.900 --> 05:58.780
the farmers harvested grains and wheat and

05:58.780 --> 06:01.780
barley, we would have to give them to the

06:01.780 --> 06:04.520
Chinese so being unable to endure the

06:04.520 --> 06:06.780
suffering my husband and I and children

06:06.780 --> 06:09.860
fled or went to went to Lhasa. Went to

06:09.860 --> 06:14.940
Lhasa, right. So what memories do you have

06:14.940 --> 06:17.100
of your childhood when you were a little

06:17.100 --> 06:17.440
girl?

06:32.120 --> 06:34.560
What should I say about when I was little?

06:46.620 --> 06:50.920
I have no memories of my younger days.

06:51.680 --> 06:56.040
Okay. What did your mother do? Son, Doyul

06:56.040 --> 06:56.660
and daughter, now who's learning about the

06:56.660 --> 06:59.760
mother's wife-to-be and daughter-in-law's

06:59.760 --> 07:02.720
wife-to-be- 처. Mother's only daughter has

07:02.720 --> 07:06.580
half 15 years left from birth, otherwise

07:06.580 --> 07:11.720
she would still lose them. So we took them

07:11.720 --> 07:15.760
together, we were still helping and female

07:15.760 --> 07:15.760
and male sons.

07:36.540 --> 07:43.840
So in the commune she was, she had the

07:43.840 --> 07:45.740
task of milking and then she would milk

07:45.740 --> 07:48.260
the cows. And then also carrying hay on

07:48.260 --> 07:51.500
the back to be spread under the horses and

07:51.500 --> 07:54.960
mules. And then after we escaped, I had no

07:54.960 --> 07:59.140
idea about them, but I think they have all

07:59.140 --> 08:03.300
passed away now. So did you help your

08:03.300 --> 08:05.420
mother or your father with their work on

08:05.420 --> 08:05.900
the commune?

08:25.480 --> 08:26.080
No,

08:30.080 --> 08:33.000
because I had little children then, and so

08:33.000 --> 08:35.180
instead of helping them, I needed their

08:35.180 --> 08:35.620
help.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.740
How old were you when you had your first

08:40.740 --> 08:41.120
child?

09:03.760 --> 09:08.800
So we don't normally calculate our years

09:08.800 --> 09:11.480
and ages. So it was like, you know,

09:11.520 --> 09:14.100
animals giving birth. Likewise, we too

09:14.100 --> 09:18.440
gave birth to our children. Do your

09:18.440 --> 09:19.500
children live with you now?

09:26.940 --> 09:31.280
No, not together. I have three children,

09:31.400 --> 09:35.100
and I had my children in the hospital. Can

09:35.100 --> 09:37.620
you tell us about your experiences giving

09:37.620 --> 09:41.140
birth to children? So, Marwa, you are a

09:41.140 --> 09:43.760
very good teacher. You have taught us a

09:43.760 --> 09:47.180
lot of things. So, what do you think about

09:47.180 --> 09:50.840
teaching us how to be a good teacher? I

09:50.840 --> 09:53.820
don't know how to teach. I have been

09:53.820 --> 09:56.760
teaching since I was a child. I have been

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
teaching since I was a child. I don't know

09:58.760 --> 10:02.720
how to teach. I don't know how to teach. I

10:02.720 --> 10:04.660
don't know how to teach. I don't know how

10:04.660 --> 10:05.000
to teach.

10:14.620 --> 10:20.880
So I didn't give

10:20.880 --> 10:26.060
birth

10:26.060 --> 10:29.460
in hospitals and it was my husband that

10:29.460 --> 10:34.940
helped me during the childbirth. and it

10:34.940 --> 10:38.320
is only my daughter that was born in

10:38.320 --> 10:40.740
hospital and I couldn't give birth to her

10:40.740 --> 10:43.220
and all my other children including the

10:43.220 --> 10:47.660
twins were not born in hospital. How did

10:47.660 --> 10:48.740
your husband help you?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.940
I was a little girl, and I was a little

11:02.940 --> 11:07.000
girl. I was a little girl, and I was a

11:07.000 --> 11:10.140
little girl. I was a little girl, and I

11:10.140 --> 11:11.280
was a little girl. I was a little girl,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.540
and I was a little girl. I was a little

11:13.540 --> 11:17.380
girl, and I was a little girl. I was a

11:17.380 --> 11:20.680
little girl, and I was a little girl. I

11:20.680 --> 11:21.500
was a little girl, and I was a little

11:21.500 --> 11:21.780
girl.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.720
So when the first of the twins was born, I

11:44.720 --> 11:48.480
was on my knees and my husband, he took

11:48.480 --> 11:50.780
the child wrapped it in cloth and laid it

11:50.780 --> 11:54.220
on the bed and then I went out to answer

11:54.220 --> 11:57.140
nature's call and then I could feel that

11:57.140 --> 12:00.900
there was another child in me and so I

12:00.900 --> 12:03.800
told my husband that there is one more

12:03.800 --> 12:07.040
child and he said it can't be but then I

12:07.040 --> 12:09.420
said there is one more and then the other

12:09.420 --> 12:12.720
one was born and while breastfeeding I had

12:12.720 --> 12:15.440
to feed one child here and one child here

12:15.440 --> 12:17.900
and it was same when I was feeding them

12:17.900 --> 12:21.540
food later. At the same time, feeding them

12:21.540 --> 12:23.740
one here, one here? At the same time.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.020
Thujujjipa le chikla omadetje, chikla

12:26.020 --> 12:29.200
omadetje, roa? Nyaka tew. Nyaka ngode.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.620
Ngode nyaka sumte omadetje. Yes, because

12:32.620 --> 12:35.360
both cried at the same time. Cried, cried.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.760
And were all your children healthy when

12:38.760 --> 12:41.200
they were born? Amla, puku ketiw ka ne

12:41.200 --> 12:46.140
puku tsangma tangpo duwe? Shubha Bhat is

12:46.140 --> 12:47.340
bright and his father was doing that, he

12:47.340 --> 12:47.340
said.

13:13.600 --> 13:19.360
So the second The second of the twins was

13:19.360 --> 13:22.840
born leg first and I thought it was a

13:22.840 --> 13:26.600
headless child. And then my husband pulled

13:26.600 --> 13:29.360
it out and there was no crying so I

13:29.360 --> 13:31.920
thought it wasn't alive. And when I

13:31.920 --> 13:34.300
touched the leg it was warm and then my

13:34.300 --> 13:39.000
husband cleaned it up. How did you feel?

13:39.080 --> 13:42.580
Can you remember your emotions? Your

13:42.580 --> 13:44.420
mother's strength. When Mother went home,

13:44.660 --> 13:47.140
She told Your mother She wanted her to

13:47.140 --> 13:49.100
follow She самой đihistoric practice

13:49.100 --> 13:49.940
father and sister through her daughter

13:49.940 --> 13:55.220
Very little, very little

13:56.900 --> 13:59.980
water was sweeping she could not go to

13:59.980 --> 14:05.740
Sangam and they robbed her of everything

14:05.740 --> 14:08.700
was leaving there

14:20.320 --> 14:24.600
So the twins, you know, if one child is

14:24.600 --> 14:28.300
born,

14:28.300 --> 14:30.340
I was the only one who was sick. I was the

14:30.340 --> 14:32.220
only one who was sick. I was the only one

14:32.220 --> 14:33.180
who was sick. I was the only one who was

14:33.180 --> 14:38.780
sick. So the twins, you know, if one child

14:38.780 --> 14:41.240
got sick around 12 o'clock, the other

14:41.240 --> 14:44.980
would become sick at 3pm. So both had to

14:44.980 --> 14:48.000
be carried to the hospital in Pasa. And it

14:48.000 --> 14:50.020
was very difficult. And then later my

14:50.020 --> 14:52.640
husband found work at a construction site.

14:53.060 --> 14:57.020
And I could also find work, but I couldn't

14:57.020 --> 15:01.180
do much as I was sick most of the time. So

15:01.180 --> 15:03.360
when you were sick, who took care of your

15:03.360 --> 15:03.880
children? one.

15:09.720 --> 15:23.280
There wasn't

15:23.280 --> 15:26.020
anyone else to take care of them. I had to

15:26.020 --> 15:27.660
and then when my husband been returned

15:27.660 --> 15:29.860
from work then we took care of them

15:29.860 --> 15:34.160
together so when you lived in Lhasa did

15:34.160 --> 15:38.520
you have family who also lived in Lhasa or

15:38.520 --> 15:39.380
lived near you

15:42.280 --> 15:45.280
I'm lucky that not me down pinga shambhala

15:45.280 --> 15:48.080
in the hustle a your a your mother no no

15:48.080 --> 15:52.960
both of us didn't have any relatives so

15:52.960 --> 15:58.600
you said that you went to Lhasa and you

15:58.600 --> 16:02.020
had three children what what made your

16:02.020 --> 16:03.240
family go to Lhasa?

16:44.580 --> 16:49.140
So we had to leave our hometown because we

16:49.140 --> 16:51.680
couldn't survive there. there, there was

16:51.680 --> 16:54.660
lack of food because if you couldn't work

16:54.660 --> 16:57.740
hard, there was no grains for you, and

16:57.740 --> 17:00.960
then since we had many children, both of

17:00.960 --> 17:04.200
us couldn't survive there and that's why

17:04.200 --> 17:06.680
my husband suggested that we go to Lhasa.

17:08.060 --> 17:12.460
Why wasn't there enough food? And Magali,

17:12.580 --> 17:16.960
how do you do the work? We do it by hand.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.140
We do it by hand. We do it by hand. We do

17:25.140 --> 17:27.620
it by hand. We do it by hand.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.860
So in the commune system, you know, if you

17:39.860 --> 17:44.220
could work, the officials gave you marks,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.940
and if you didn't, you know, there was no

17:46.940 --> 17:48.940
marks, which meant that you got no grains.

17:50.680 --> 17:56.360
But you worked, didn't you? Did you eat

17:56.360 --> 17:56.420
anything?

18:01.880 --> 18:02.920
We did,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.720
but there was nothing to eat, so we left.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.640
Was it because you had so many children

18:12.640 --> 18:14.560
that what you were allowed, what you were

18:14.560 --> 18:17.080
allocated wasn't enough? So, sağ name

18:17.080 --> 18:21.640
shows that he had pressure. Yes, I had

18:21.640 --> 18:21.940
pressure.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.880
Now, I'm a little tired, now I feel

18:27.880 --> 18:30.580
confident about any poverty machine but

18:30.580 --> 18:32.800
they do that for me to come on the study

18:32.800 --> 18:35.860
people to gonna and they have a yes I did

18:35.860 --> 18:40.620
say what any last another lots of jelly

18:40.620 --> 18:45.720
Chito Joseph never know he said yeah the

18:45.720 --> 18:49.200
allocation

18:49.200 --> 18:52.600
wasn't sufficient and then when we were in

18:52.600 --> 18:55.420
Hussar a friend of my husband suggested

18:55.420 --> 18:58.880
that you know since we had many children

18:58.880 --> 19:02.440
that if we went to Nepal it would be a

19:02.440 --> 19:04.740
better life for the children so that's why

19:04.740 --> 19:10.740
we came to Nepal. Right I'd like we'll

19:10.740 --> 19:13.040
come back to Nepal in a minute but I was

19:13.040 --> 19:16.660
wondering in what ways was life in Lhasa

19:16.660 --> 19:20.120
different from life in the village?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.700
Amal, we met in Thangbo with Amal on the

19:29.700 --> 19:33.880
road. Did you ask her about the Kepa

19:33.880 --> 19:36.960
recipe? Yes,

19:39.220 --> 19:46.360
we did. As a child and as prends theorist,

19:46.540 --> 19:47.540
we juts see people family village,

19:49.060 --> 19:51.240
aromatic powder and they drink it. It was

19:51.240 --> 19:54.400
a more herbal and Standing mother plant

19:54.400 --> 19:58.480
that we sourced. How old were you? I was

19:58.480 --> 20:01.240
very young. I was very young. I was very

20:01.240 --> 20:04.920
young. I was very young. I was very young.

20:06.980 --> 20:12.460
I was very young. I was very young. You

20:12.460 --> 20:16.380
were very young. Were you very young? Were

20:16.380 --> 20:20.760
you very young? Yes, I was very young. I

20:20.760 --> 20:21.660
was very young.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.520
So it was better in Lhasa because my

20:32.520 --> 20:34.900
husband was engaged in the construction

20:34.900 --> 20:37.780
work and then friends and other people,

20:37.860 --> 20:40.160
they used to give us little bags of Sampa.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.800
Were there other ways in which your life

20:43.800 --> 20:45.540
in Lhasa was different from the village?

20:45.740 --> 20:48.680
You had more food, but were there other

20:48.680 --> 20:50.260
ways in which your life was different?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.680
I don't know, I can't say.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.220
So I have only so much to say. Right. So

21:13.220 --> 21:17.800
your family decided to come to Nepal. Can

21:17.800 --> 21:20.900
you tell us the story of coming to Nepal?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.720
Now if I mistook it for decrease forление

21:51.940 --> 21:53.920
or decrease You

22:23.560 --> 22:24.660
We were so afraid, being because of his

22:24.660 --> 22:30.660
laziness. He said that the monk who made

22:30.660 --> 22:31.280
usiden

23:06.720 --> 23:10.760
So from Lhasa there were times when we

23:10.760 --> 23:14.360
were on foot and at times for an hour or

23:14.360 --> 23:17.300
two we would ply by vehicles but since we

23:17.300 --> 23:20.500
didn't have money to pay we couldn't get

23:20.500 --> 23:23.940
vehicles right through and it was from the

23:23.940 --> 23:27.340
border area of Tengri and Tamo that we

23:27.340 --> 23:31.540
came towards Nepal. And we were with quite

23:31.540 --> 23:33.860
a number of little children, and my

23:33.860 --> 23:37.360
husband was carrying one of the twins over

23:37.360 --> 23:40.340
his neck, and the oldest son was carrying

23:40.340 --> 23:44.500
one of the other twins, and the pathway

23:44.500 --> 23:47.500
was filled with snow, and there were some

23:47.500 --> 23:49.920
Chinese people along the way that stopped

23:49.920 --> 23:52.580
us, but since we were with little children

23:52.580 --> 23:55.500
they allowed us to go and in fact there

23:55.500 --> 23:58.080
were two girls that commented that the

23:58.080 --> 24:01.400
twins were very beautiful and then thanks

24:01.400 --> 24:03.620
thanks to the grace of His Holiness we

24:03.620 --> 24:07.920
were able to escape safely how long did it

24:07.920 --> 24:10.940
take you to come from Lhasa to Nepal?

24:30.960 --> 24:34.140
So it might have taken about half a month,

24:34.300 --> 24:36.780
because at times we were walking and at

24:36.780 --> 24:39.320
times we could get lift in some vehicles.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.460
So what did you take with you when you

24:42.460 --> 24:48.240
left Tibet? the Via Norma to you on the

24:48.240 --> 24:52.080
canne am LIE prison to do If somebody who

24:52.080 --> 24:57.320
is just trying and just wants to make

24:57.320 --> 25:01.080
their life better… This particular

25:01.080 --> 25:10.740
religion can also get real

25:10.740 --> 25:10.760
cells.

25:20.140 --> 25:23.540
So we had brought nothing except our

25:23.540 --> 25:27.460
blankets and a little bit of tsampa. And

25:27.460 --> 25:30.580
when we reached Nepal, my husband had

25:30.580 --> 25:33.300
friends to whom we sent message, and they

25:33.300 --> 25:36.120
came to fetch us at the reception

25:36.120 --> 25:40.680
committee office. And did you have enough

25:40.680 --> 25:43.840
food, enough sampa for your whole family

25:43.840 --> 25:45.620
to go for these two weeks?

26:07.140 --> 26:09.160
included by the people with disabilities,

26:09.800 --> 26:11.160
as well as the women of the village sick

26:11.160 --> 26:16.500
and badly harmed by the virus, . We didn't

26:16.500 --> 26:18.440
change these rules. We didn't go back to

26:18.440 --> 26:21.900
our roots of education andidades like I

26:21.900 --> 26:26.240
said, Naipa. There was no one I would

26:26.240 --> 26:28.380
create in my village, there was no one I

26:28.380 --> 26:29.400
wouldak to know and expose old women. if

26:29.400 --> 26:33.740
they had listened to the government

26:33.740 --> 26:34.320
quarantine regulations, I was a young

26:34.320 --> 26:37.520
girl, and I was a young girl. I was a

26:37.520 --> 26:41.560
young girl, and I was a young girl. I was

26:41.560 --> 26:44.060
a young girl, and I was a young girl. I

26:44.060 --> 26:44.940
was a young girl, and I was a young girl.

26:45.580 --> 26:48.420
I was a young girl, and I was a young

26:48.420 --> 26:50.720
girl. I was a young girl, and I was a

26:50.720 --> 26:53.020
young girl. I was a young girl, and I was

26:53.020 --> 26:56.560
a young girl. I was a young girl, and I

26:56.560 --> 26:59.600
was a young girl. I was a young girl, and

26:59.600 --> 27:01.300
I was a young girl. I was a young girl,

27:01.340 --> 27:02.660
and I was a young girl.

27:25.280 --> 27:29.420
So we had a little bit of tsampa, and I

27:29.420 --> 27:31.840
used to feed the children in spoonfuls,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.760
which they used to gulp and then we were

27:34.760 --> 27:38.100
able to you know cross over a mountain and

27:38.100 --> 27:40.840
there was a river and nearby we found some

27:40.840 --> 27:43.380
Nepalese police and we were really very

27:43.380 --> 27:47.720
scared and I told my husband you know will

27:47.720 --> 27:50.880
they not kill us now and then we met some

27:50.880 --> 27:53.580
merchants who said that now you need have

27:53.580 --> 27:55.920
no fear because you will you are in

27:55.920 --> 27:58.720
Nepalese territory and you will no longer

27:58.720 --> 28:01.600
fall into Chinese hands But still they

28:01.600 --> 28:05.900
were very scared. And then we saw some

28:05.900 --> 28:09.680
Nepali road crew and they were living in

28:09.680 --> 28:14.060
little tents. And so we entered one of the

28:14.060 --> 28:17.060
tents and they gave us hot water and I

28:17.060 --> 28:21.500
made little balls of dough with the Sampa

28:21.500 --> 28:24.360
and hot water and fed my children. And

28:24.360 --> 28:27.280
then we went to Dharamsala and we were

28:27.280 --> 28:29.360
very happy to see His Holiness the Dalai

28:31.200 --> 28:37.360
So you arrived in Nepal and then how did

28:37.360 --> 28:38.780
you get to Dharamsala?

28:48.240 --> 28:53.080
The reception committee there dropped us

28:53.080 --> 28:57.740
to Dharamsala. I want to go back to make

28:57.740 --> 29:00.460
sure I've understood something. So your

29:00.460 --> 29:03.940
decision to leave Nepal, I mean to leave

29:03.940 --> 29:08.280
Tibet, was because of hunger? What was the

29:08.280 --> 29:10.400
reason why you left Tibet? Tibet.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.760
soma thwa tsawa machi o criminals

29:59.100 --> 30:03.760
So the reason

30:03.760 --> 30:07.280
why we left our hometown one time was the

30:07.280 --> 30:10.780
lack of food and livelihood in Hassa was

30:10.780 --> 30:14.200
better than in the hometown, but our

30:14.200 --> 30:16.760
children were not getting any education in

30:16.760 --> 30:19.660
Hassa, and we were told that if we went to

30:19.660 --> 30:22.040
Nepal, we would be able to admit our

30:22.040 --> 30:24.400
children into school. So for the sake of

30:24.400 --> 30:29.960
our children, we left Tibet. Right. So you

30:29.960 --> 30:34.180
lived in Tibet when the Chinese were

30:34.180 --> 30:37.720
there. How is life like for you under the

30:37.720 --> 30:38.040
Chinese?

31:04.440 --> 31:07.840
So I do not have much knowledge. That's

31:07.840 --> 31:11.080
between in the offices, that happens, and

31:11.080 --> 31:15.820
my job was just doing my work. And your

31:15.820 --> 31:17.820
work was what? What was your work?

31:41.640 --> 31:46.460
So our responsibility was harvesting the

31:46.460 --> 31:51.520
parni and then de-husking them in a large

31:51.520 --> 31:55.300
open ground during the commune, but I have

31:55.300 --> 31:58.280
forgotten much of it. What about in Lhasa?

31:58.440 --> 32:05.440
What was your work in Lhasa? So, it's

32:05.440 --> 32:26.740
like

32:26.740 --> 32:28.160
what I told you earlier, here,

32:28.220 --> 32:31.040
constructing houses, digging the ground,

32:31.260 --> 32:33.740
laying the bricks, and building as it

32:33.740 --> 32:37.140
happens here. You did that? Amla adina la

32:37.140 --> 32:39.300
lera chey na, kama basura dwe adina la?

32:39.680 --> 32:43.340
Nga lera ka zote me na, nade. Lera ka zote

32:43.340 --> 32:47.120
me. No, I couldn't go to work because I

32:47.120 --> 32:53.000
was sick. Right. Okay. Did you have any

32:53.000 --> 32:55.920
interactions with Chinese people?

33:05.920 --> 33:06.640
No.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.660
So did life change for you when the

33:12.660 --> 33:14.920
Chinese came to Tibet?

33:20.520 --> 33:21.920
Yes,

33:43.780 --> 33:49.000
in In 1961-62, by then the Chinese had

33:49.000 --> 33:51.900
already launched the liberation. And at

33:51.900 --> 33:54.160
that time, when my husband and I escaped,

33:55.200 --> 33:59.580
there wasn't many people escaping then,

33:59.800 --> 34:02.520
but later on, more and more people started

34:02.520 --> 34:09.160
coming. And what happened then? We were in

34:09.160 --> 34:12.860
the same house. You mean the same house?

34:12.920 --> 34:13.140
No.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.120
Once we were at the reception center here

34:40.120 --> 34:42.920
and then we were sent to see His Holiness

34:42.920 --> 34:45.360
the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala and then the

34:45.360 --> 34:47.640
children were put in school and then my

34:47.640 --> 34:50.700
husband and I we were sent to a factory in

34:50.700 --> 34:53.740
Dalahousey in Himachal Pradesh and then

34:53.740 --> 34:56.460
there was no problem at all. Was your

34:56.460 --> 34:58.980
husband affected at all by the Chinese

34:58.980 --> 34:59.500
occupation?

35:12.920 --> 35:14.880
Is theidoe different from your social

35:14.880 --> 35:18.620
ladder in the community? The entrance was

35:18.620 --> 35:23.680
different the opportunity was the idea of

35:23.680 --> 35:25.000
the Orion I entered old earth with all my

35:25.000 --> 35:30.960
knowledge and now I'm

35:30.960 --> 35:39.560
together

35:39.560 --> 35:44.100
with the children worker in Pasta and he

35:44.100 --> 35:48.820
was you know laying the iron rods for the

35:48.820 --> 35:51.480
construction and then after coming into

35:51.480 --> 35:55.320
India and he worked as a embosser of

35:55.320 --> 36:00.000
handmade carpets. Right at the beginning

36:00.000 --> 36:03.260
you mentioned that most of your children

36:03.260 --> 36:06.460
except for your last child were born at

36:06.460 --> 36:09.160
home but one child was born in the

36:09.160 --> 36:12.300
hospital. Why was that child born in the

36:12.300 --> 36:14.420
hospital? What caused you to take that you

36:14.420 --> 36:15.840
know go to the hospital for that?

36:40.280 --> 36:43.740
So, I was having labor pains, but could

36:43.740 --> 36:46.340
not give birth, so that's why I went to

36:46.340 --> 36:50.980
the hospital. And your baby was safe. Yes,

36:51.640 --> 36:55.680
I know it. I know it. Thank You, she塊se.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.480
When I was a little child. 종 came and gave

36:59.480 --> 37:07.300
us ricepoins. They used to dull

37:07.300 --> 37:09.900
away ricepoins.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.040
Very hard.

37:19.040 --> 37:24.780
I was very sad. I was very sad. I was very

37:24.780 --> 37:31.260
sad. I was very sad. I was very sad. I was

37:31.260 --> 37:32.220
very sad.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.400
Yes, the last child was born in hospital

37:38.400 --> 37:42.100
after five or six days. Actually, the

37:42.100 --> 37:44.940
labor pains had started and the child

37:44.940 --> 37:48.280
wasn't born. So the nurse told me that I

37:48.280 --> 37:50.160
would have to stay in hospital for a few

37:50.160 --> 37:52.720
days because it was a big child. But I

37:52.720 --> 37:54.740
didn't want to stay and wanted to go back

37:54.740 --> 37:58.960
home. And my husband said that, you know,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.460
wouldn't take me home, saying that, you

38:01.460 --> 38:04.040
know, if we went back home, the child and

38:04.040 --> 38:08.800
I would die. Is there anything else that

38:08.800 --> 38:10.620
you would like to share with us about your

38:10.620 --> 38:13.840
life in Tibet? We are very happy to have

38:13.840 --> 38:17.180
you here. We are very happy to have you

38:17.180 --> 38:22.360
here. That's about it. That's about it.

38:22.520 --> 38:27.580
Thank you. If this interview were shown in

38:27.580 --> 38:30.300
Tibet or China, would it be a problem for

38:30.300 --> 38:30.540
you?

38:47.540 --> 38:50.460
I don't know whether there will be any

38:50.460 --> 38:53.500
problems or no problems. Is it okay if we

38:53.500 --> 38:54.520
use your real name?

39:08.960 --> 39:11.600
Yeah, but then if the Chinese come and

39:11.600 --> 39:15.040
investigate, they may take me away. Thank

39:15.040 --> 39:17.240
you very much for sharing your story with

39:17.240 --> 39:17.480
us.
