WEBVTT

00:06.420 --> 00:09.220
Thank you.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
for it because the fact that the more I

00:33.000 --> 00:36.560
doubt over this reminds me of my years of

00:36.560 --> 00:39.220
law study when the end of the fourth year

00:39.220 --> 00:39.900
came along.

00:48.260 --> 00:52.300
Subject, but I get by the bar anyway. Now

00:52.300 --> 00:55.920
I am particularly interested in this

00:55.920 --> 00:59.040
subject. I came connected with a firm

00:59.040 --> 01:00.860
called Salvage and Lee, it was a public

01:00.860 --> 01:03.800
relations firm. Now the reason I say this,

01:03.820 --> 01:06.620
because I was in charge, was having my

01:06.620 --> 01:10.100
opinions made biased or prejudiced or

01:10.100 --> 01:13.040
whatnot, because I am connected with this

01:13.040 --> 01:15.900
public relations firm. The only thing, I

01:15.900 --> 01:18.160
gave this a whole lot of thinking, and the

01:18.160 --> 01:19.540
reason I explained it, two years because

01:19.540 --> 01:21.460
there have been many questions asked about

01:21.460 --> 01:25.440
it throughout the country. I thought of it

01:25.440 --> 01:28.060
and I said, well, a soldier who is in the

01:28.060 --> 01:30.580
field, such as I'm a major in the reserve,

01:30.840 --> 01:34.000
I'm paid. Am I this less this lawyer

01:34.000 --> 01:37.380
because I'm paid? A man who's an

01:37.380 --> 01:41.260
ambassador, is he less loyal to the

01:41.260 --> 01:43.760
country because he's paid? On the other

01:43.760 --> 01:46.020
hand, a man has certain obligations to his

01:46.020 --> 01:49.040
family. I have three boys, one of them is

01:49.040 --> 01:53.040
going to college. and I thought I was

01:53.040 --> 01:55.180
going to proceed on this whole business,

01:55.360 --> 01:59.100
but nothing. My wife quickly discouraged

01:59.100 --> 02:01.180
me of that, reminding me that I had three

02:01.180 --> 02:04.920
sons and one of them in college, and I'd

02:04.920 --> 02:08.180
better think twice before proceeding on

02:08.180 --> 02:10.980
such a close of activity. Now that fully

02:10.980 --> 02:13.620
explains my situation so that you people

02:13.620 --> 02:16.460
can assess for yourselves house whatever i

02:16.460 --> 02:19.940
have to say if you want to do so now

02:19.940 --> 02:25.680
ladies and gentlemen when a man is a

02:25.680 --> 02:30.020
certain ethnic group and then he hears bad

02:30.020 --> 02:33.260
things about that ethnic group and all his

02:33.260 --> 02:35.940
life he's heard nothing but the best of

02:35.940 --> 02:40.300
his uh his ancestors or people from whom

02:40.300 --> 02:42.980
he is descendants and in my case i'm uh

02:42.980 --> 02:45.860
i'm not even the senator i was born there

02:45.860 --> 02:48.640
and i always thought the portuguese had a

02:48.640 --> 02:51.660
fine western reputation but they were

02:51.660 --> 02:54.400
people that made certain accountabilities

02:54.400 --> 02:59.480
in civilization especially in discovery

02:59.480 --> 03:03.920
pathology and science and navigation i

03:03.920 --> 03:05.620
also know and this I want to tell you

03:05.620 --> 03:07.160
something strange to you, that in the

03:07.160 --> 03:09.540
history of literature, the great

03:09.540 --> 03:12.220
contributions of the culture of today are

03:12.220 --> 03:15.240
entirely unknown. We have writers who are

03:15.240 --> 03:17.120
equal in dignity, intelligence, and

03:17.120 --> 03:19.240
humility. I say this because I've studied

03:19.240 --> 03:21.340
them, and I think I'm the native to make a

03:21.340 --> 03:23.960
comparison. We have also great grammars.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.460
We have probably the second outstanding

03:27.460 --> 03:31.160
epic poet of the world in Camões. Don't

03:31.160 --> 03:34.120
take it from my own authority. Take it

03:34.120 --> 03:38.120
from Cecil Bowles. Oh, my goodness. Come

03:38.120 --> 03:44.980
on, second only. Who are you? So I

03:44.980 --> 03:47.680
undertook, with all this interest, to look

03:47.680 --> 03:49.600
into several charges that were being made.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.660
One of the charges was that a human, and

03:54.660 --> 03:59.260
called her a Moslem, was a grave terror. A

03:59.260 --> 04:00.060
grave terror.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.380
Now, I may be approaching this wrong, but

04:05.380 --> 04:07.200
I'm going to do it so that you can push it

04:07.200 --> 04:10.600
in. A reign of terror, in my own opinion,

04:10.820 --> 04:14.580
at least it implies this, minimally

04:14.580 --> 04:18.760
implies it. An apprehension of fear. An

04:18.760 --> 04:22.780
intending danger. Now, if it doesn't imply

04:22.780 --> 04:24.520
that, if it doesn't have that, then I

04:24.520 --> 04:27.020
don't know what a reign of terror is. It

04:27.020 --> 04:32.700
may mean other things, but it may mean

04:32.700 --> 04:35.720
the exact course of place he lost in 1516.

04:36.200 --> 04:41.140
And there are the non-border Angola and

04:41.140 --> 04:46.040
the terrorist king Donald Trump and Hitler

04:46.040 --> 04:46.430
massacred

04:49.390 --> 04:57.970
Now if this job is very dangerous, I don't

04:57.970 --> 05:03.770
see it. I don't see it. I don't see it.

05:04.190 --> 05:08.650
Please hold the hand over. And I see about

05:08.650 --> 05:12.610
the eight. and, unfortunately, in 200,000

05:12.610 --> 05:18.670
colors. A perfect makeup, where there was

05:18.670 --> 05:22.610
no lack of the green of the eyes and the

05:22.610 --> 05:25.270
brown of the color of the nose. Her

05:25.270 --> 05:30.370
husband, Alexei, at the time, wore the

05:30.370 --> 05:35.410
sun's halo with a heart-shaped coat. They

05:35.410 --> 05:39.090
traveled over the Euro, they traveled over

05:39.090 --> 05:42.770
the course, they reached the southern part

05:42.770 --> 05:45.530
of the country. They could not reach the

05:45.530 --> 05:49.350
northern part of the country. Tell me

05:49.350 --> 05:52.350
who's this? The great, small, established

05:52.350 --> 05:57.510
Soviet. The way it has to be. Some of the

05:57.510 --> 05:59.390
students don't stop without having a

05:59.390 --> 06:03.810
drink. I mean, they're the boys. Now, when

06:03.810 --> 06:07.950
I arrived in Luanda, I actually did not

06:07.950 --> 06:16.070
observe the type of city. I know that the

06:16.070 --> 06:18.650
story of the Maristus came in from the

06:18.650 --> 06:21.490
Maristus. I know that the city was a place

06:21.490 --> 06:25.450
of wonder. All the wonderful things that

06:25.450 --> 06:27.430
he managed to do. The beautiful city of

06:27.430 --> 06:32.110
the sea. The scope of architecture is one

06:32.110 --> 06:35.250
of the most futuristic. One of the

06:35.250 --> 06:38.210
loveliest places. Well, there's another

06:38.210 --> 06:46.570
area. The Giro de Gara. Also, the Giro de

06:46.570 --> 06:49.090
Gara. The Giro de Gara. The Giro de Gara.

06:49.250 --> 06:52.570
The Giro de Gara.

06:59.890 --> 07:01.290
رف

07:26.370 --> 07:29.230
or you're a police officer, or you're a

07:29.230 --> 07:32.070
police administrator, or you're some other

07:32.070 --> 07:35.490
official. People aren't running towards

07:35.490 --> 07:38.650
you. I don't think that that represents

07:38.650 --> 07:42.570
fear. They ask questions of all citizens

07:42.570 --> 07:44.610
here, and if this is universal, that

07:44.610 --> 07:47.690
doesn't mean it's fear. Fear would mean

07:47.690 --> 07:51.330
that people run away from you. Just get

07:51.330 --> 07:55.490
out of your way. That's fear. Now, the

07:55.490 --> 07:57.270
next problem that I was very much

07:57.270 --> 07:59.190
interested in checking with the tourists

07:59.190 --> 08:04.650
was that it is said that there are rising

08:04.650 --> 08:06.650
expectations of NASA.

08:09.670 --> 08:13.050
Now, rising expectations, that is a huge

08:13.050 --> 08:17.710
phrase, rising expectations of NASA. And

08:17.710 --> 08:22.510
so, is this view of heaven the same? And

08:22.510 --> 08:26.890
so, is this view of heaven the same? I ask

08:26.890 --> 08:28.030
the question of heaven? I ask the question

08:28.030 --> 08:32.650
of heaven? There is a difference.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.450
There is a difference.

08:40.170 --> 08:42.690
I want to know what are you getting at?

08:42.730 --> 08:43.510
What is this writing?

08:48.290 --> 08:54.050
I want to get it down. Listen. I listen to

08:54.050 --> 08:56.770
you. You are the one who has to respond to

08:56.770 --> 08:57.930
me. You are the one who has to accept

08:57.930 --> 09:03.470
after the act. This man has to accept me.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.870
I am the one who has to accept me. I am

09:05.870 --> 09:11.050
the one who has to accept you. I learn and

09:11.050 --> 09:13.070
live my life. I am the one who has to

09:13.070 --> 09:14.210
accept me.

09:16.870 --> 09:19.710
Well, what is this? Jesús, what is the

09:19.710 --> 09:23.590
next? What about?

09:27.470 --> 09:30.310
What about tête?угure?

09:34.130 --> 09:36.090
Cat. Huh. He,

09:40.510 --> 09:41.550
Saio?

09:56.130 --> 09:58.270
The same thing that you hear from

09:58.270 --> 10:05.250
Englishmen. . . . . . . . . . . . to be in

10:05.250 --> 10:08.270
the academy. And so, it was a special time

10:08.270 --> 10:14.030
in our day. Now, this is an example that

10:14.030 --> 10:19.210
is also implied that these people were

10:19.210 --> 10:21.790
more involved in the talk. People were

10:21.790 --> 10:25.810
involved in the mass media. The mass

10:25.810 --> 10:30.990
media. But they were all anxious to

10:30.990 --> 10:32.170
establish themselves themselves

10:32.170 --> 10:34.850
independent of the metropolitan portico

10:34.850 --> 10:37.990
and the independent nation of Angola and

10:37.990 --> 10:40.210
Angolese, is that the thing that they

10:40.210 --> 10:43.010
said? Well, that's what they mean, I

10:43.010 --> 10:45.550
didn't see it. And remember what I told

10:45.550 --> 10:48.690
you, I didn't see it.

10:52.770 --> 10:55.450
They kept writing and they kept saying

10:55.450 --> 10:55.730
that.

11:01.870 --> 11:05.770
That would be a nationalism, continue the

11:05.770 --> 11:09.170
traditional associations, which is what

11:09.170 --> 11:12.010
they mean in Portugal. Could that be a

11:12.010 --> 11:14.730
nationalism? Could that be? But I didn't

11:14.730 --> 11:17.750
find, this is nationalism, the morning of

11:17.750 --> 11:21.090
a place separate from the mother country.

11:21.410 --> 11:25.870
I didn't find it there. I didn't see it

11:25.870 --> 11:26.030
there.

11:33.050 --> 11:33.650
is

11:47.070 --> 11:50.090
now the next question i was interested in

11:50.090 --> 11:50.450
was this

11:56.030 --> 11:59.730
of the multiracial design. Now this is a

11:59.730 --> 12:03.070
very interesting thing of the immigrants

12:04.750 --> 12:06.010
in the United States.

12:09.510 --> 12:13.150
Multiracial design. Some have tried, but

12:13.150 --> 12:17.690
that's a fake. I say that's not a fake. If

12:17.690 --> 12:19.230
there's anything that the Portuguese have

12:19.230 --> 12:22.950
done in the beginning of their history,

12:22.990 --> 12:26.070
they have mixed with all races. regardless

12:26.070 --> 12:30.790
of color, regardless of country. I don't

12:30.790 --> 12:32.490
know why it is. Perhaps it's because of

12:32.490 --> 12:35.350
the history of Portugal. Portuguese have

12:35.350 --> 12:37.930
been a pride to discard color in marriage

12:37.930 --> 12:39.210
and religious associations.

12:42.110 --> 12:45.050
Cape Verde Islands is certainly a proof of

12:45.050 --> 12:47.990
that. The Portuguese state of India is

12:47.990 --> 12:50.450
certainly another proof of that. And

12:50.450 --> 12:52.930
Brazil is certainly another proof of that.

13:08.570 --> 13:13.230
I say you investigate the thing because my

13:13.230 --> 13:15.670
experience being Portuguese and knowing

13:15.670 --> 13:18.430
those In both situations it is not a fact.

13:19.330 --> 13:24.770
Multiracial society is genuine, harmonious

13:24.770 --> 13:28.470
for existence of the races, regardless of

13:28.470 --> 13:32.890
the pigment of one's skin. Now that's what

13:32.890 --> 13:40.150
I saw. That's what I knew. Now, what is

13:40.150 --> 13:42.050
this that's taking place in the world?

13:43.750 --> 13:50.410
What is it that Mr. Gavoy says? What is it

13:50.410 --> 13:53.530
that Mr. and Truman, John, do?

13:59.390 --> 14:04.090
Read the Negro author yourself. Black

14:04.090 --> 14:08.350
supremacy. Black supremacy is the moral of

14:08.350 --> 14:09.210
the United States.

14:12.510 --> 14:15.290
And if you're going to have black

14:15.290 --> 14:20.010
supremacy in these areas, that is being...

14:20.010 --> 14:23.190
This is the point where I say the other

14:23.190 --> 14:28.270
city is a squire. I don't think that's the

14:28.270 --> 14:30.810
case. In fact, I think the only solution

14:30.810 --> 14:33.990
to the problem is that Portugal is giving

14:33.990 --> 14:38.630
to the world. That's the only story for

14:38.630 --> 14:41.270
this thing. This thing is the best premise

14:41.270 --> 14:44.050
for the play of the week. It's full of

14:44.050 --> 14:48.470
delusions of men. Full of premeditated

14:48.470 --> 14:51.230
premonitions. All the odds and sides. And

14:51.230 --> 14:54.190
the middle of the show is on the... You do

14:54.190 --> 14:56.850
know I... You do know I... You do know

14:56.850 --> 15:02.150
I... I suppose every

15:02.150 --> 15:04.710
race of man is child. uh

15:20.350 --> 15:28.430
if this principle of black supremacy takes

15:28.430 --> 15:31.850
root, and I hope it does, if this

15:31.850 --> 15:34.450
principle of black supremacy takes root in

15:34.450 --> 15:39.570
Africa, I want you to think seriously of

15:39.570 --> 15:44.150
the effect, the impact it's going to have

15:44.150 --> 15:47.230
on many people in the United States,

15:47.470 --> 15:52.730
especially in the southern states. Because

15:52.730 --> 15:57.910
their thinking runs, if the Negro thinks

15:57.910 --> 16:01.010
this way, if he's speaking this way, then

16:01.010 --> 16:03.330
what is preventing him from trying to

16:03.330 --> 16:06.310
apply the same principle in the southern

16:06.310 --> 16:12.090
states? I say to you, think twice. There's

16:12.090 --> 16:14.650
a much better solution to these problems

16:14.650 --> 16:18.790
than the idea of supremacy for the white

16:18.790 --> 16:25.210
or supremacy for the black. Now the other

16:25.210 --> 16:28.650
thing that hurt me a great deal, as a

16:28.650 --> 16:32.770
question, is that charge with sadistic

16:32.770 --> 16:33.250
activities.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.750
isolated cases. I suppose if you were to

16:38.750 --> 16:42.530
take the days of the Fox clan, or the days

16:42.530 --> 16:47.950
of even Boston, some periods I've seen,

16:48.230 --> 16:52.150
and some of the experiences that I also

16:52.150 --> 16:54.950
have, incident in Japan, if you were to

16:54.950 --> 16:57.930
take a series of isolated instances,

16:58.330 --> 17:03.670
gather them together, you'd probably come

17:03.670 --> 17:05.990
to the conclusion that these people are

17:05.990 --> 17:09.670
sadistic. It reminds me one time I had an

17:09.670 --> 17:14.650
operation on my left eye, surprising to

17:14.650 --> 17:17.770
me, more of a cataract, an impact that I

17:17.770 --> 17:20.910
received. And I was in the hospital about

17:20.910 --> 17:22.990
six or seven days and when I get out I

17:22.990 --> 17:26.630
thought everybody had eye trouble. So be

17:26.630 --> 17:31.150
sure that your vision has greater scope

17:31.150 --> 17:35.990
than believing isolated cases which in

17:35.990 --> 17:38.530
most instances are presented without

17:38.530 --> 17:42.390
proof. And I as one say that a man makes a

17:42.390 --> 17:45.050
statement as I know he's a fabricator.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.530
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt to

17:47.530 --> 17:51.470
say it's true. But I didn't see any

17:51.470 --> 17:55.530
sadistic activity myself. A sadistic

17:55.530 --> 17:59.390
activity would be the use of the hand

17:59.390 --> 18:04.030
-rapper that I have seen in the paper,

18:04.210 --> 18:07.930
where one gentleman holds it out and the

18:07.930 --> 18:10.550
other sends it hand, and they demonstrate

18:10.550 --> 18:14.830
how the hand-rapper confuses. that they

18:14.830 --> 18:18.390
call the ponderatoria. I didn't see it. I

18:18.390 --> 18:19.890
know that when I was a boy I was beaten

18:19.890 --> 18:24.370
with a cane by Mr. Emerson, and there's

18:24.370 --> 18:26.830
the principal then for doing things that I

18:26.830 --> 18:29.330
shouldn't do as a boy. I suppose that

18:29.330 --> 18:32.710
would be, that's called a punishment, and

18:32.710 --> 18:36.290
that would cause someone to raise the

18:36.290 --> 18:39.010
eyebrow. But for sadistic activities,

18:39.190 --> 18:41.470
ladies and gentlemen, I didn't see any

18:41.470 --> 18:47.750
sadistic activities. Now the problem of

18:47.750 --> 18:52.990
education. This seems to be the

18:52.990 --> 18:56.630
opportunity of all the systems, with

18:56.630 --> 19:02.750
regard to defending itself against all

19:02.750 --> 19:06.990
these charges. It has been said that there

19:06.990 --> 19:13.830
is a low literacy rate in that. And I as

19:13.830 --> 19:17.390
an individual will say yes. And others

19:17.390 --> 19:20.950
will say yes. And then there are other

19:20.950 --> 19:23.490
statements that bring the term national.

19:28.270 --> 19:32.250
And because of the first accusation,

19:32.250 --> 19:34.770
accusations of wrecking the others

19:34.770 --> 19:39.690
acquired from truth. I have heard various

19:39.690 --> 19:42.650
statements that the literacy rate, for

19:42.650 --> 19:43.470
example, is decreasing.

19:47.070 --> 19:50.330
I, uh, the study missionaries for the

19:50.330 --> 19:53.450
French patril industry can tell the

19:53.450 --> 19:57.250
difference. Something called, meter. They

19:57.250 --> 20:00.290
said they listed a number of countries and

20:00.290 --> 20:06.430
they gained pipes. Pipes. Now, what is the

20:06.430 --> 20:12.110
story of the grapes? I know. The reason

20:12.110 --> 20:14.930
for this is that if machinery is built,

20:14.930 --> 20:17.270
they cook separate grapes. Some of the

20:17.270 --> 20:19.210
estate people who bought the...

20:19.210 --> 20:21.150
...impartialized the taste of the wine,

20:21.230 --> 20:23.230
the rich areas, the man-made skin areas,

20:23.350 --> 20:24.850
they mentioned that they used to...

20:24.850 --> 20:27.610
...breeze that one time. This aroma and

20:27.610 --> 20:29.850
taste are so important... But I noticed in

20:29.850 --> 20:32.590
an article in the Zedby book that they are

20:32.590 --> 20:37.590
tenacious.

20:40.110 --> 20:43.830
My own figure from my observation is

20:43.830 --> 20:47.150
between 15 and 12 centimeters. That's the

20:47.150 --> 20:49.870
figure I take. And it's just 15

20:49.870 --> 20:52.030
centimeters. rather similar to Champagne,

20:52.090 --> 20:55.770
and the very

20:55.770 --> 20:58.050
sweet wines of the area around Grand Ole.

20:59.110 --> 21:01.650
One of the famous wines which is mentioned

21:01.650 --> 21:03.990
in English literature is a dill, namely

21:03.990 --> 21:05.590
Mamsie wine. I would say, for example,

21:05.650 --> 21:08.910
about 77% of the dill is a Grand Ole Grand

21:08.910 --> 21:12.630
Ole. The special characteristic of these

21:12.630 --> 21:17.570
are about approximately 70% of Champagne.

21:18.850 --> 21:21.170
These tribes each speak a dialect.

21:24.190 --> 21:26.550
Now, unfortunately, there are many people

21:26.550 --> 21:29.730
who use this language in their own

21:29.730 --> 21:33.030
language. These people don't understand

21:33.030 --> 21:37.230
that type of a thing. So it has made a

21:37.230 --> 21:40.830
contribution in that direction. It hasn't

21:40.830 --> 21:44.810
done anything else. Now, what I didn't see

21:44.810 --> 21:50.850
there, is that the average

21:50.850 --> 21:53.770
age of the administrator that I found in

21:53.770 --> 22:00.510
the area was 42, 43 years. There were only

22:00.510 --> 22:04.350
two administrators, two governors, and I

22:04.350 --> 22:07.650
met two of them over that. I could only be

22:07.650 --> 22:12.290
in northern was a colonel retired, a

22:12.290 --> 22:15.890
fellow by the name of Modesta and that was

22:15.890 --> 22:19.110
the moment of grief. The average age of

22:19.110 --> 22:24.390
the district governor was about 42. And

22:24.390 --> 22:26.590
there were two or three exceptions. There

22:26.590 --> 22:29.990
appeared to be a military that was able to

22:29.990 --> 22:36.190
option for him. and I also noticed the

22:36.190 --> 22:40.710
enthusiasm for the work of the city of

22:40.710 --> 22:44.670
Doris. It reminded me very much of the

22:44.670 --> 22:50.590
situation in Japan. I was there, the

22:50.590 --> 22:53.470
enthusiasm we had for the Civil Affairs

22:53.470 --> 22:58.650
and Military Government teams. So you have

22:58.650 --> 23:02.170
a great emphasis there to get these things

23:02.170 --> 23:07.250
done that have been said to be lacking in

23:07.250 --> 23:11.030
these areas. Effective law education.

23:13.030 --> 23:17.790
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't see this as

23:17.790 --> 23:24.090
an excuse for lack of education. But if

23:24.090 --> 23:27.170
you examine the record, if you examine the

23:27.170 --> 23:32.730
record of the airwaves, what you'll find

23:32.730 --> 23:35.110
is that they are very, very nice.

23:47.230 --> 23:51.510
I think that I've taken enough time to

23:51.510 --> 23:51.510
explain to you what I mean by the

23:51.510 --> 23:55.650
airwaves. I'm going to... There are

23:55.650 --> 24:01.050
several things I'd like to ask. If the

24:01.050 --> 24:06.210
enemies of the British push demand the

24:06.210 --> 24:08.310
immediate surrender of Angola,

24:11.210 --> 24:16.690
I want one. The fool. Who do you negotiate

24:16.690 --> 24:23.210
with? If they say you negotiate with the

24:23.210 --> 24:29.930
Nazis, or the rebels, or what you like to

24:29.930 --> 24:35.310
call terrorists, then that's

24:35.310 --> 24:38.110
just a thing you can say out there. You

24:38.110 --> 24:42.330
negotiate with whom? to negotiate with? To

24:42.330 --> 24:44.830
whom do you turn the reins of government?

24:46.450 --> 24:49.870
Who do you negotiate with? I want to know

24:49.870 --> 24:52.250
who are these people who claim that they

24:52.250 --> 24:56.270
represent the people of Angola? Who are

24:56.270 --> 25:02.090
they? Where do they come from? And if you

25:02.090 --> 25:07.450
say, own your battles, marry the Niazak,

25:07.450 --> 25:11.210
out if you say these two men represent the

25:11.210 --> 25:15.190
people of angola where is the element of

25:15.190 --> 25:19.330
self-determination isn't self

25:19.330 --> 25:23.190
-determination doesn't signify that people

25:23.190 --> 25:27.730
have a choice is this

25:27.730 --> 25:30.990
to

25:30.990 --> 25:31.410
be achieved

25:37.450 --> 25:40.670
the exceptional philosophy that I was not

25:40.670 --> 25:45.150
here to pursue. He did surrender to the

25:45.150 --> 25:47.890
mere fact that the country is not repaired

25:47.890 --> 25:53.550
is no excuse. Now the missionaries have

25:53.550 --> 26:01.270
said negotiate. I was home. Was home. And

26:01.270 --> 26:04.450
I'm very important to the state. And if a

26:04.450 --> 26:07.010
man says, I represent the United States,

26:08.310 --> 26:12.050
the people have to know that it's like the

26:12.050 --> 26:16.330
following of the political campaign, the

26:16.330 --> 26:19.890
Supreme Court, the Supreme Court doesn't

26:19.890 --> 26:23.190
represent its whites. The economy tells us

26:23.190 --> 26:25.850
exactly what the situation is. But a man

26:25.850 --> 26:30.710
says, I represent this. I was in street

26:30.710 --> 26:34.750
commerce for hours. I commented. I asked,

26:34.770 --> 26:35.890
do you know Holger Barrow?

26:38.650 --> 26:42.090
Good. The same thing I applied when I

26:42.090 --> 26:46.450
said, you know, you know, I didn't know

26:46.450 --> 26:50.910
him. I was just, I was just, he was named

26:50.910 --> 26:52.050
by me. Good.

26:56.010 --> 27:01.110
I wonder if the claim is that Holden Perot

27:01.110 --> 27:06.090
actually represents somebody. Harry

27:06.090 --> 27:08.550
Leandrani is the defendant, John Merriman.

27:09.210 --> 27:12.030
Holden Perot has denied any comments.

27:27.150 --> 27:31.410
I would stake my right arm on him. that if

27:31.410 --> 27:34.010
Holden Roberto ever takes control of

27:34.010 --> 27:37.070
Angola, he will be another Castro, and

27:37.070 --> 27:39.110
I'll stake my right arm, and I'll be like

27:39.110 --> 27:41.330
that rope who put it right over the fire

27:41.330 --> 27:44.490
and committed it to burn. The Holden

27:44.490 --> 27:46.770
-Roberto method is not that way.

27:49.550 --> 27:55.550
They say, well, truth is very high. Other,

27:55.610 --> 27:59.670
other things. The Chinese are interested.

28:00.770 --> 28:04.730
The end is near. The beginnings are very,

28:04.770 --> 28:07.790
very quiet. There are the great, great,

28:07.930 --> 28:11.750
great, expression of the ideas of the

28:11.750 --> 28:15.750
years. More racism, more discrimination,

28:16.350 --> 28:19.670
more politics, and the ideas of the great,

28:19.710 --> 28:23.210
great, great, and the public health

28:23.210 --> 28:26.790
statistics. And all of the others, and

28:26.790 --> 28:30.650
they were

28:30.650 --> 28:38.310
not living

28:38.310 --> 28:40.330
with God. They were living with God as

28:40.330 --> 28:42.370
well as they were living with God. And the

28:42.370 --> 28:45.610
fact that the comparisons were bothering

28:45.610 --> 28:48.370
us in Herod, the comparisons were to the

28:48.370 --> 28:52.030
hymn. now let's not make the same mistake

28:52.030 --> 28:58.470
in this whole business of anger. I am so

28:58.470 --> 29:04.010
out of the behind human hearts. I would

29:04.010 --> 29:07.730
like to see no man that's in my way that

29:07.730 --> 29:11.590
works for me, I can't otherwise than the

29:11.590 --> 29:13.730
interest of ours and the opportunity.

29:15.990 --> 29:20.270
Remember this, the one thing that perhaps

29:20.270 --> 29:25.590
Perhaps we should understand that these

29:25.590 --> 29:31.270
tribes in Angola, because of their past

29:31.270 --> 29:34.950
history, have not had the economic

29:34.950 --> 29:40.690
incentives that perhaps the mind-minds of

29:40.690 --> 29:43.970
the British are so bad. I think the work

29:43.970 --> 29:46.150
that's going on here, the people who have

29:46.150 --> 29:49.070
been gathered to build, you're getting

29:49.070 --> 29:53.770
people who are people who don't see the

29:53.770 --> 29:57.850
question. You're getting an education, and

29:57.850 --> 29:59.890
the education making it possible for them

29:59.890 --> 30:04.350
to take advantage of the job. That's

30:04.350 --> 30:06.790
wonderful. Everybody is all in favor of

30:06.790 --> 30:10.250
that. But there's also a disinformation

30:10.250 --> 30:13.450
among the men who are charged with student

30:13.450 --> 30:16.390
abuse, and more than that information. I

30:16.390 --> 30:18.530
sometimes wonder whether the matter should

30:18.530 --> 30:24.050
not be imposed on a compulsory basis. I

30:24.050 --> 30:25.630
think there are some laws in this country

30:25.630 --> 30:27.610
I know of that are not sending children to

30:27.610 --> 30:29.070
school and get out of the parents' house

30:29.070 --> 30:31.210
and forced them to go to school. Well,

30:31.470 --> 30:35.510
there hasn't been this impulsory feature

30:35.510 --> 30:40.190
of education in Angola. Then you have

30:40.190 --> 30:44.470
problems of society, for example. The

30:44.470 --> 30:47.630
tribe there has certain customs to live

30:47.630 --> 30:49.750
by. I think it means that that's separate.

30:50.830 --> 30:53.190
I'm not from Angola. I'm from Angola. I'm

30:53.190 --> 30:57.010
from Angola. I'm from Angola. I'm from

30:57.010 --> 30:57.530
Angola.

31:12.670 --> 31:19.010
I have seen

31:19.010 --> 31:23.210
night schools with hundreds going to

31:23.210 --> 31:25.430
thousands if you want to, of all the

31:25.430 --> 31:28.370
students. of students who were studying

31:28.370 --> 31:31.310
and now maybe this is something that

31:31.310 --> 31:35.130
should just come up. I don't know. I saw

31:35.130 --> 31:38.890
this business. I also have a friend who I

31:38.890 --> 31:41.750
met who was planning and just asked a

31:41.750 --> 31:46.390
little girl to assist him to read to see

31:46.390 --> 31:47.770
how well she was doing.
