WEBVTT

00:02.060 --> 00:03.900
All right, now first of all, I'd like to

00:03.900 --> 00:08.700
get some background questions. What year

00:08.700 --> 00:12.100
are you in college? Senior. And where do

00:12.100 --> 00:14.520
you go to college? Stanford. And how many

00:14.520 --> 00:17.620
years have you been here? All four. What

00:17.620 --> 00:19.460
is your major field of study at Stanford?

00:19.600 --> 00:23.340
Oh, it's mathematics. And what do you plan

00:23.340 --> 00:26.800
to do after graduation? Computer

00:26.800 --> 00:30.780
programming. In this area? Yeah, in San

00:30.780 --> 00:35.660
Francisco. Where is your permanent address

00:35.660 --> 00:37.140
when you're not living in San Francisco?

00:37.220 --> 00:42.440
It's in Fresno, California. And where did

00:42.440 --> 00:46.140
you go to high school? In Fresno, McLean

00:46.140 --> 00:49.620
High School. Now, did you have much

00:49.620 --> 00:52.560
contact with people of different racial or

00:52.560 --> 00:54.500
ethnic backgrounds in the high school that

00:54.500 --> 00:57.140
you went to? No, there was very little. It

00:57.140 --> 01:00.340
was in the part of town where there

01:00.340 --> 01:03.460
weren't very many people from other racial

01:03.460 --> 01:07.460
groups. Now if you can think back to the

01:07.460 --> 01:11.320
time before you came to Stanford as a

01:11.320 --> 01:13.140
freshman, can you remember then what your

01:13.140 --> 01:14.800
feeling towards civil rights was?

01:18.260 --> 01:25.160
Well, I thought that everybody should have

01:25.160 --> 01:26.920
the same rights that they didn't, but they

01:26.920 --> 01:30.880
should have. People, you know, of all

01:30.880 --> 01:34.380
races and groups. Now, would you say that

01:34.380 --> 01:37.260
your opinion towards civil rights has

01:37.260 --> 01:39.600
changed since coming to Stanford, and if

01:39.600 --> 01:44.300
so, how? Well, I've felt more strongly in

01:44.300 --> 01:46.880
favor of civil rights, especially since

01:46.880 --> 01:50.100
it's become more of an issue since I've

01:50.100 --> 01:53.340
been in college. Would you say that you

01:53.340 --> 01:55.140
have become more aware of civil rights?

01:55.360 --> 01:58.260
Yes, definitely. And what do you think

01:58.260 --> 02:01.400
would be the main sources of awareness?

02:03.460 --> 02:06.900
Well, a lot of it, like I said, has become

02:06.900 --> 02:10.420
an issue. And on college campuses too, or

02:10.420 --> 02:13.000
at Stanford, it sort of has become more of

02:13.000 --> 02:15.800
an issue. There's more, you can't really

02:15.800 --> 02:18.220
avoid the issue anymore. At home, my

02:18.220 --> 02:21.700
parents were not exactly tolerant. And

02:21.700 --> 02:23.500
they just, I mean, we just didn't discuss

02:23.500 --> 02:25.720
it very much at home. But here there's

02:25.720 --> 02:30.200
more discussion of it. Well, has your

02:30.200 --> 02:32.220
exposure to the Civil Rights Movement been

02:32.220 --> 02:35.840
mainly through the mass media, or through

02:35.840 --> 02:38.280
talking with friends in the dormitory, or

02:38.280 --> 02:41.200
other people that perhaps have gone to

02:41.200 --> 02:44.760
work in the Civil Rights Movement? Mostly

02:44.760 --> 02:49.260
through the mass media. Some discussion,

02:49.440 --> 02:51.240
but not too much. A lot of it's just been,

02:51.260 --> 02:54.020
yeah, reading about it, or hearing about

02:54.020 --> 02:58.620
it on the news. Now, do you discuss

02:58.620 --> 03:01.580
political or social or racial issues very

03:01.580 --> 03:06.840
much with your family? Not too much. It's

03:06.840 --> 03:09.300
not a subject that we bring up too much

03:09.300 --> 03:13.020
because we don't agree. Now, to what

03:13.020 --> 03:16.180
extent are you influenced by the feelings

03:16.180 --> 03:19.040
of your parents? In other words, if you

03:19.040 --> 03:21.780
were strongly in favor of something that,

03:21.840 --> 03:24.540
of making some decision that they were

03:24.540 --> 03:27.520
opposed to, would their opposition keep

03:27.520 --> 03:30.700
you from making that decision? No. I'd

03:30.700 --> 03:35.520
consider their point of view and see if

03:35.520 --> 03:39.160
that had any bearing on, you know, I'd

03:39.160 --> 03:41.780
appreciate their standpoint, but I'd make

03:41.780 --> 03:44.840
my own decision regardless of theirs,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.500
although I'd listen to what they had to

03:48.500 --> 03:51.680
say. Are you financially dependent on your

03:51.680 --> 03:52.020
parents?

03:54.720 --> 03:58.420
Somewhat. Not entirely. And do you think

03:58.420 --> 04:01.460
that this could be a factor in making you

04:01.460 --> 04:03.860
go along with their wishes even though you

04:03.860 --> 04:07.540
didn't agree with them? Well, not in any

04:07.540 --> 04:10.040
major... I mean, not in any personal

04:10.040 --> 04:11.600
thing. In things like going to college,

04:11.640 --> 04:15.840
yes. But in any personal thing, no. Okay,

04:16.160 --> 04:18.640
now you mentioned that your main exposure

04:18.640 --> 04:20.860
to the Civil Rights Movement has been the

04:20.860 --> 04:24.900
mass media. Now what would you say were

04:24.900 --> 04:26.680
the main goals of the Civil Rights

04:26.680 --> 04:28.260
Movement as you see it?

04:32.220 --> 04:36.040
Well, to provide the same opportunities

04:36.040 --> 04:41.040
for everybody, regardless of the color of

04:41.040 --> 04:43.400
their skin or their, mostly that's the

04:43.400 --> 04:47.140
issue, to give them all the rights that

04:47.140 --> 04:51.220
they may not have now, but should have as

04:51.220 --> 04:53.720
American citizens. Oh, what rights

04:53.720 --> 04:55.520
specifically? Well, voting rights,

04:55.740 --> 04:59.540
educational rights, employment

04:59.540 --> 05:02.640
opportunities. Are you in favor of these

05:02.640 --> 05:06.260
goals of the movement? as long as it's

05:06.260 --> 05:12.080
done without making, forcing them into

05:12.080 --> 05:15.100
some place where they don't, like saying,

05:15.200 --> 05:16.880
well, this man has to be hired because

05:16.880 --> 05:19.400
he's a Negro, regardless of whether he may

05:19.400 --> 05:23.320
not be as qualified as some white person.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.000
I mean, I think that they should be

05:26.000 --> 05:29.980
considered, regardless of it, not because

05:29.980 --> 05:31.700
they are a Negro or because they are

05:31.700 --> 05:33.980
white, but because they are qualified. I

05:33.980 --> 05:36.400
think there's sort of a tendency to say,

05:36.480 --> 05:38.640
well, now you have to give him a job

05:38.640 --> 05:40.340
because he's colored and you have to have

05:40.340 --> 05:43.060
so many colored people or something. Well,

05:43.120 --> 05:47.060
do you think that the movement is trying

05:47.060 --> 05:49.100
to take into consideration the fact that

05:49.100 --> 05:50.980
perhaps the Negro has been culturally

05:50.980 --> 05:53.700
deprived and maybe he isn't as qualified?

05:57.720 --> 06:02.980
I don't know. I don't think, I don't

06:02.980 --> 06:06.880
really think that's anything,

06:07.180 --> 06:09.460
that's a real apparent thing that they're

06:09.460 --> 06:11.420
working at. They're working, it seems to

06:11.420 --> 06:14.220
me like they're trying to put him in a

06:14.220 --> 06:16.220
position, whether or not he may be as

06:16.220 --> 06:19.280
qualified, to make him pretend that he's

06:19.280 --> 06:22.160
he's qualified, whether or not he may be,

06:22.260 --> 06:26.300
to say he should be qualified, even if he

06:26.300 --> 06:29.100
may not be as well educated. What do you

06:29.100 --> 06:31.400
think are the means employed by the Civil

06:31.400 --> 06:34.700
Rights Movement and are you in favor of

06:34.700 --> 06:35.200
these means?

06:38.540 --> 06:41.080
Some of the means I'm in favor of and some

06:41.080 --> 06:43.500
of them, I think, of course, part of it is

06:43.500 --> 06:46.380
keeping interest. I think one of their big

06:46.380 --> 06:48.260
things is keeping things stirred up so

06:48.260 --> 06:49.860
people are always aware of this instead of

06:49.860 --> 06:52.200
just sort of letting it go along as it has

06:52.200 --> 06:54.240
for the last hundred years, saying, well,

06:54.300 --> 06:57.620
we'll make this, we're all the same, but

06:57.620 --> 07:02.000
then letting people discriminate. I think

07:02.000 --> 07:03.760
that they're trying to keep it stirred up

07:03.760 --> 07:05.880
so that there's active interest and people

07:05.880 --> 07:09.980
become interested. But I think some of

07:09.980 --> 07:12.620
these South Tantics, well like the

07:12.620 --> 07:14.680
Scythians, sometimes they're stirring up

07:14.680 --> 07:19.120
antagonism that is really going to not

07:19.120 --> 07:22.820
help the cause by really forcing the issue

07:22.820 --> 07:25.660
down the throats of the Southerners who

07:25.660 --> 07:32.440
aren't quite willing to take it. What is

07:32.440 --> 07:35.140
your opinion toward the employment of

07:35.140 --> 07:37.520
civil disobedience? Do you feel that this

07:37.520 --> 07:38.940
is right or wrong as a method?

07:42.000 --> 07:47.160
I think that it... I don't really think

07:47.160 --> 07:50.360
that it's right. You mean like fit-ins and

07:50.360 --> 07:55.560
that sort of thing? I think are a little

07:55.560 --> 07:57.580
strong because I think they create a lot

07:57.580 --> 08:03.260
of antagonism that is not necessarily good

08:03.260 --> 08:07.360
because it's those who are not

08:07.360 --> 08:09.260
particularly in favor of civil rights are

08:09.260 --> 08:11.360
not going to be condensed by the fact that

08:11.360 --> 08:13.420
all these people are sort of sitting there

08:13.420 --> 08:20.080
in their way or doing something to create

08:20.080 --> 08:23.080
this antagonism. What kind of means do you

08:23.080 --> 08:24.120
think should be employed?

08:26.840 --> 08:30.600
That I'm not sure of. I mean, if I thought

08:30.600 --> 08:33.120
I knew the answer, I think that a lot of

08:33.120 --> 08:35.040
people would like to know it. I'd like to

08:35.040 --> 08:38.460
talk to you. Now, as you may have read, a

08:38.460 --> 08:40.720
lot of college students from the north,

08:40.860 --> 08:43.140
well, from areas other than the south, are

08:43.140 --> 08:45.380
going to Mississippi and Alabama and these

08:45.380 --> 08:47.780
different areas to work in the civil

08:47.780 --> 08:51.040
rights movement as freedom workers, voter

08:51.040 --> 08:53.400
registration. Do you know any people that

08:53.400 --> 08:57.380
have gone down south in this capacity? A

08:57.380 --> 09:01.800
couple. If you think specifically of these

09:01.800 --> 09:04.940
people, what is your opinion of these kind

09:04.940 --> 09:09.840
of persons that go to the South? Well, of

09:09.840 --> 09:11.780
course they're very active. They're people

09:11.780 --> 09:14.000
who are very interested and aware of

09:14.000 --> 09:19.600
what's going on. Although I think in some

09:19.600 --> 09:24.060
cases they may be sort of... well, I think

09:24.060 --> 09:26.180
they mean well, but don't quite exactly

09:26.180 --> 09:28.040
know what they're going into. Sometimes

09:28.040 --> 09:31.380
it's sort of the attitude of they know

09:31.380 --> 09:34.220
what should be done, but don't always

09:34.220 --> 09:38.080
realize all the circumstances, but are

09:38.080 --> 09:39.400
kind of going down there with this fresh,

09:39.460 --> 09:44.060
eager look, a little bit naive maybe,

09:44.580 --> 09:49.020
thinking that they know what's right, and

09:49.020 --> 09:50.060
they're going to go down there and solve

09:50.060 --> 09:53.820
the problem for the world. Do you think

09:53.820 --> 09:55.560
that the students involved in the Civil

09:55.560 --> 09:57.240
Rights Movement are contributing anything

09:57.240 --> 10:01.140
to the movement? And if so, what? I think

10:01.140 --> 10:05.140
in some cases they can, yes. Like when

10:05.140 --> 10:07.840
they're trying to educate the people and

10:07.840 --> 10:10.860
to help them, help the Negro people

10:10.860 --> 10:14.320
improve themselves. I think they can make

10:14.320 --> 10:18.660
a valuable contribution, but sometimes I

10:18.660 --> 10:22.440
think with such an influx that they also,

10:22.700 --> 10:27.180
the southerners will think, or do think

10:27.180 --> 10:29.280
that, you know, all these kids are coming

10:29.280 --> 10:31.760
down there and telling us what to do. And

10:31.760 --> 10:34.140
I think that they, there's a little too

10:34.140 --> 10:36.440
much of it to where they're sort of, you

10:36.440 --> 10:38.540
know, it's the attitude of well the north

10:38.540 --> 10:39.900
is going to show the south how to run

10:39.900 --> 10:43.220
their life, or or their lives and it can

10:43.220 --> 10:49.040
create dissension. Now, do you know people

10:49.040 --> 10:52.940
within your living group or on campus that

10:52.940 --> 10:55.220
are sympathetic towards civil rights but

10:55.220 --> 10:59.580
yet have not gone to the South? Yes. Now,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.640
what would you think is the difference

11:02.640 --> 11:04.420
between someone who is sympathetic towards

11:04.420 --> 11:07.000
civil rights in favor of the means being

11:07.000 --> 11:09.500
employed and the goals of the civil rights

11:09.500 --> 11:11.940
movement and does not go south from the

11:11.940 --> 11:14.020
student who does go south?

11:17.020 --> 11:21.260
Well, part of it is it takes, you have to

11:21.260 --> 11:24.760
be just a little, well, not carefully, but

11:24.760 --> 11:27.380
you have to be willing to sort of, you

11:27.380 --> 11:29.340
have to be very adventuresome to sort of

11:29.340 --> 11:31.220
leave in the middle of school and run down

11:31.220 --> 11:32.880
there to do something for a week or two. I

11:32.880 --> 11:35.700
think it takes, if somebody really looking

11:35.700 --> 11:38.120
for something, I think that those who go

11:38.120 --> 11:39.480
down there are sort of looking for

11:39.480 --> 11:41.600
something kind of exciting.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.780
In addition to wanting to help, I think

11:46.780 --> 11:48.160
they're sort of looking for something to

11:48.160 --> 11:51.560
get in on. You know, they want to get in

11:51.560 --> 11:54.220
on it. Whereas those who stay here, of

11:54.220 --> 11:56.020
course someone would like to go and can't.

11:56.840 --> 12:01.040
But those who really do go are, in a way,

12:01.080 --> 12:03.260
are sort of, you know, it's kind of an

12:03.260 --> 12:07.340
adventure in some cases. Do you think the

12:07.340 --> 12:09.300
spirit of adventure characterizes the

12:09.300 --> 12:11.340
people that you mentioned before that you

12:11.340 --> 12:13.820
know that have gone south? Some of them.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.720
Some of them, yes, and some of them maybe

12:16.720 --> 12:19.080
not so much. I mean, some of them are...

12:20.020 --> 12:22.220
They have to be, in a way, sort of

12:22.220 --> 12:24.000
adventuresome because it is a long way to

12:24.000 --> 12:25.660
go, to go down there for a week or two.

12:25.820 --> 12:27.680
And it's something new and sort of

12:27.680 --> 12:30.340
different. But there's a lot more to it

12:30.340 --> 12:34.500
than that. What do you think it involves

12:34.500 --> 12:37.400
besides the spirit of adventure? Well, a

12:37.400 --> 12:40.800
basic belief in what they're doing. I

12:40.800 --> 12:42.680
mean, it's sort of an idealistic thing

12:42.680 --> 12:46.000
that they think that they can... to want

12:46.000 --> 12:48.820
to help, but it involves... I mean, they

12:48.820 --> 12:51.240
have to honestly want to do something

12:51.240 --> 12:53.340
because it's a lot of trouble to go down

12:53.340 --> 12:55.320
there. And it's... they're people who are

12:55.320 --> 12:58.120
really interested and concerned. How about

12:58.120 --> 12:59.960
people that really seem interested and

12:59.960 --> 13:01.760
concerned and speak in favor of civil

13:01.760 --> 13:04.680
rights, but yet they don't take that final

13:04.680 --> 13:08.500
step of going down south? Well, you know,

13:08.500 --> 13:10.200
perhaps some of them just aren't able to

13:10.200 --> 13:14.280
go in some cases, or else they don't

13:14.280 --> 13:18.640
really think that they could, there's

13:18.640 --> 13:19.980
anything that they personally could

13:19.980 --> 13:22.300
contribute by going down there. I think

13:22.300 --> 13:25.020
that that's, in some situations, is

13:25.020 --> 13:27.800
probably the case, that they feel that if

13:27.800 --> 13:29.200
they, you know, they don't have anything

13:29.200 --> 13:32.640
to positively contribute personally by

13:32.640 --> 13:34.760
going down there. Now, if you had the

13:34.760 --> 13:36.880
opportunity to go to the South as a civil

13:36.880 --> 13:41.700
rights worker, would you go? I don't think

13:41.700 --> 13:45.620
so, no. And why would you not go? Well,

13:45.760 --> 13:47.900
first of all, my parents would just about

13:47.900 --> 13:52.480
tell me to forget to come back. I mean, I

13:52.480 --> 13:57.200
just hate to... I mean, if I really wanted

13:57.200 --> 14:01.280
to go, I'd go anyway. But it would really

14:01.280 --> 14:03.560
cause a lot of trouble. But besides that,

14:03.640 --> 14:06.680
I don't think that there's that much that

14:06.680 --> 14:09.240
I, as one person, could contribute down

14:09.240 --> 14:10.880
there. That I wouldn't know what I was

14:10.880 --> 14:14.480
going into. to. And exactly, I don't think

14:14.480 --> 14:16.260
I know the whole situation. And I'd like

14:16.260 --> 14:18.040
to go down and see the situation, but I

14:18.040 --> 14:21.320
don't know if I would be qualified to

14:21.320 --> 14:26.580
really contribute anything myself. Well,

14:26.660 --> 14:28.360
what kind of qualities do you think that

14:28.360 --> 14:31.260
SNCC and CORE and the NAACP and these

14:31.260 --> 14:33.560
different groups look for in a person?

14:33.640 --> 14:36.520
What kind of abilities to be performed in

14:36.520 --> 14:41.060
a civil rights worker? Well, it has to be

14:41.060 --> 14:45.300
somebody really willing to make the

14:45.300 --> 14:47.360
sacrifice of getting down there. I think

14:47.360 --> 14:51.120
they pay a lot of their own expenses. And,

14:51.120 --> 14:54.540
you know, give up a week or two at school,

14:54.660 --> 14:56.920
which a lot of people would like to do if

14:56.920 --> 15:00.780
they could. But really it is a sacrifice

15:00.780 --> 15:04.380
to go down and work. and it has to be

15:04.380 --> 15:05.480
somebody who really believes in what

15:05.480 --> 15:07.780
they're doing, enough that they wouldn't

15:07.780 --> 15:13.220
get discouraged. And yet I think or at

15:13.220 --> 15:14.420
least I hope they're looking for people

15:14.420 --> 15:16.620
who aren't going to go down to cause

15:16.620 --> 15:18.440
trouble but are going down there sincerely

15:18.440 --> 15:22.640
to work and not just do a little bit of

15:22.640 --> 15:25.700
rabble-rousing. Now you speak in terms of

15:25.700 --> 15:27.500
students that go down for a week or two

15:27.500 --> 15:30.240
off school. How about students that go

15:30.240 --> 15:32.420
down for the entire summer to give their

15:32.420 --> 15:33.860
time, Would you ever consider this

15:33.860 --> 15:40.700
possibility? Well, not, I never of course

15:40.700 --> 15:42.820
have had a summer when I could just go

15:42.820 --> 15:48.760
down, but for myself, I don't think I'd do

15:48.760 --> 15:51.780
it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't

15:51.780 --> 15:55.820
because it's a long time to go down. And

15:55.820 --> 15:58.320
like I said, I don't know if I'd have that

15:58.320 --> 16:00.120
much to contribute once I got down there.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.540
Now, have you ever been involved in any

16:03.540 --> 16:05.560
civil rights activities on a local level?

16:06.020 --> 16:11.340
No. Would you foresee the possibility in

16:11.340 --> 16:13.100
the future of becoming involved in civil

16:13.100 --> 16:14.160
rights on a local level?

16:17.360 --> 16:20.180
Oh, perhaps. It would depend on what it

16:20.180 --> 16:23.640
was. If it was something that I thought

16:23.640 --> 16:28.140
was valuable without being something like

16:28.140 --> 16:33.960
a sit-in. and I'd consider it, yes. But do

16:33.960 --> 16:36.760
you think that it's more valuable for

16:36.760 --> 16:40.780
these college students to go to the South

16:40.780 --> 16:42.840
where the civil rights problem has been

16:42.840 --> 16:46.280
focused so strongly? Or do you think that

16:46.280 --> 16:49.340
it is better for them to work in their own

16:49.340 --> 16:54.720
hometowns on problems of civil rights? I

16:54.720 --> 16:56.680
think they might do better in their own

16:56.680 --> 16:59.020
hometowns where they know the situation a

16:59.020 --> 17:01.460
little better and are more known

17:01.460 --> 17:05.620
themselves and more apt to be accepted by

17:05.620 --> 17:09.900
the community than they would be in, say,

17:10.040 --> 17:13.340
a southern community. I think their

17:13.340 --> 17:16.540
contribution could be a little more

17:16.540 --> 17:20.140
positive at home. Do you think that the

17:20.140 --> 17:22.020
civil rights movement in the South has had

17:22.020 --> 17:24.320
the effect of making people more

17:24.320 --> 17:27.120
interested and more concerned with their

17:27.120 --> 17:29.420
own civil rights problems in their

17:29.420 --> 17:31.280
respective communities, or do you think

17:31.280 --> 17:33.600
that it's had the effect, the opposite

17:33.600 --> 17:36.880
effect, of having people shift their own

17:36.880 --> 17:39.180
blame to the people of the South?

17:42.220 --> 17:46.120
Well, I think sort of both things have

17:46.120 --> 17:47.780
happened, depending on the area and

17:47.780 --> 17:49.240
depending on the people. there are those

17:49.240 --> 17:52.600
who, it seems to me, kind of are sweeping

17:52.600 --> 17:54.100
it under the rug and saying, well, they've

17:54.100 --> 17:55.960
got the problem and, you know, we really

17:55.960 --> 17:57.600
don't have much of a problem, but yet

17:57.600 --> 18:00.800
there's a lot, just a lot more interest in

18:00.800 --> 18:02.420
general in the problem, and people all

18:02.420 --> 18:05.760
over, even in the North, beginning to

18:05.760 --> 18:09.060
realize that they have a few racial

18:09.060 --> 18:11.860
problems of their own. But I think both

18:11.860 --> 18:12.780
things have happened,

18:15.860 --> 18:18.180
depending on the area and the group. there

18:18.180 --> 18:20.000
seems to be, like in California, there

18:20.000 --> 18:21.940
seems to be a lot more, well, interest,

18:21.940 --> 18:23.600
say, in San Francisco and Los Angeles

18:23.600 --> 18:25.560
there, and even throughout the valley.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.820
There's been more interest involved, like

18:29.820 --> 18:34.120
in Fresno, in the schools, a little more

18:34.120 --> 18:39.080
integration, because all the, sort of,

18:39.080 --> 18:41.380
there's one side of town, and then there's

18:41.380 --> 18:43.780
the other side of town, And there's one

18:43.780 --> 18:45.280
high school that's predominantly Negro

18:45.280 --> 18:48.740
and, well, Chinese and everything. But

18:48.740 --> 18:50.340
it's really a mixed, and the rest of them

18:50.340 --> 18:52.940
are predominantly white. Recently there's

18:52.940 --> 18:54.980
been a movement to mix them all around.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.820
But this sort of thing has just happened

18:58.820 --> 19:02.380
in the last couple of years. And I think

19:02.380 --> 19:06.080
more of that is going to come up in a lot

19:06.080 --> 19:08.840
of areas. Do you think that you personally

19:08.840 --> 19:12.260
have any responsibility in the Civil

19:12.260 --> 19:18.480
Rights Movement? And if so, what? Well, I

19:18.480 --> 19:26.680
think that I have a responsibility to do

19:26.680 --> 19:30.080
what I can. but then that's sort of vague

19:30.080 --> 19:36.400
to at least try personally to do, I mean

19:36.400 --> 19:39.460
to be sympathetic toward all groups and

19:39.460 --> 19:42.400
help them, you know, even in personal

19:42.400 --> 19:48.280
contact and not to personally discriminate

19:48.280 --> 19:53.740
and to try, of course, Of course, I don't

19:53.740 --> 19:55.260
know if I could go out and convince very

19:55.260 --> 19:58.960
many people, but I think, just in my own

19:58.960 --> 20:02.500
personal affairs, to do what I can. But I

20:02.500 --> 20:08.620
don't know, I don't feel that I

20:08.620 --> 20:11.680
necessarily should go down and start

20:11.680 --> 20:13.700
telling other people what to do just

20:13.700 --> 20:16.440
because I would if I thought there were

20:16.440 --> 20:19.220
anything valuable would come out of it but

20:19.220 --> 20:21.480
I think there might be a lot of

20:21.480 --> 20:24.440
resentment. Do you think that the progress

20:24.440 --> 20:25.900
of the Civil Rights Movement would

20:25.900 --> 20:28.900
continue at the same pace that it is now

20:28.900 --> 20:30.520
if there weren't any students going to the

20:30.520 --> 20:30.720
South?

20:33.880 --> 20:36.340
No, it wouldn't continue at the same pace.

20:38.700 --> 20:42.920
But and if there weren't any, if it

20:42.920 --> 20:44.560
weren't being pushed right now, things

20:44.560 --> 20:48.000
would stay pretty much like they have for

20:48.000 --> 20:51.140
the last 100 years. They advance more

20:51.140 --> 20:52.620
rapidly because everything is advancing

20:52.620 --> 20:57.780
more rapidly. But I think that had it

20:57.780 --> 20:59.920
been, the movement been maybe just not

20:59.920 --> 21:06.200
quite so strong, it might have been a

21:06.200 --> 21:07.540
little, well there had been a little less

21:07.540 --> 21:10.580
bloodshed and a little less antagonism. It

21:10.580 --> 21:14.560
had to be pushed, but I think it's been

21:14.560 --> 21:18.360
pushed a little bit too hard and a little

21:18.360 --> 21:20.080
bit too many people have been going down

21:20.080 --> 21:21.660
and saying oh we're going to straighten

21:21.660 --> 21:22.960
things out for you you don't know what

21:22.960 --> 21:25.480
you're doing down here then I think that

21:25.480 --> 21:27.000
maybe half the students could have gone

21:27.000 --> 21:30.940
down and it would have worked out a little

21:30.940 --> 21:32.980
better do you think then minimizing the

21:32.980 --> 21:34.940
numbers would have minimized the amount of

21:34.940 --> 21:37.580
bloodshed and turmoil well minimizing the

21:37.580 --> 21:41.400
whole not just the numbers but the

21:41.400 --> 21:43.820
intensity if it it had been just a little

21:43.820 --> 21:47.800
less intense, the whole program, I think

21:47.800 --> 21:52.000
would have eliminated some of the real

21:52.000 --> 21:54.660
bloodshed. Would you say then that you are

21:54.660 --> 22:01.440
in favor of not going forth as strongly as

22:01.440 --> 22:04.560
the movement presently is at the sacrifice

22:04.560 --> 22:07.260
of taking longer for these civil rights to

22:07.260 --> 22:07.680
be realized?

22:10.400 --> 22:14.920
Yes, I think so, because I think that at

22:14.920 --> 22:17.140
the same time it's realizing the civil

22:17.140 --> 22:22.700
rights there's a lot of, it's kind of

22:22.700 --> 22:25.240
messy. It would be anyway, but I think

22:25.240 --> 22:28.400
that it may have taken a little bit

22:28.400 --> 22:32.620
longer, but wouldn't have hurt so many

22:32.620 --> 22:35.600
people in the meanwhile. I don't know. I

22:35.600 --> 22:38.580
mean that's the way it appears to me and

22:38.580 --> 22:40.940
that may not be true, but that's sort of

22:40.940 --> 22:44.680
the way I would look at it. Okay, now in

22:44.680 --> 22:47.380
switching back again to your family

22:47.380 --> 22:49.540
background, what is your father's

22:49.540 --> 22:53.460
occupation? He's in the lumber business,

22:53.680 --> 22:57.920
going into road construction. And is your

22:57.920 --> 23:00.800
mother employed? No, she does my father's

23:00.800 --> 23:01.240
bookkeeping.

23:05.240 --> 23:08.500
Now, have your parents expressed any

23:08.500 --> 23:10.360
opinions on the Civil Rights Movement

23:10.360 --> 23:12.040
since they've been reading about it in the

23:12.040 --> 23:16.020
newspapers and seeing things on

23:16.020 --> 23:19.880
television? Oh yes. My father thinks that

23:19.880 --> 23:22.420
there are a lot of troublemakers in the

23:22.420 --> 23:23.700
South and they only leave things alone.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.520
That it was alright and eventually

23:26.520 --> 23:28.000
everything would have turned out alright

23:28.000 --> 23:32.080
in 200 years I guess. And my father really

23:32.080 --> 23:35.020
doesn't have much to say because I think

23:35.020 --> 23:36.300
that he probably doesn't agree with her

23:36.300 --> 23:39.060
but it's easier to keep quiet than to

23:39.060 --> 23:42.340
start a fight so. Have you ever had the

23:42.340 --> 23:46.980
opportunity to take question with your

23:46.980 --> 23:48.600
mother's pronouncements on the situation

23:48.600 --> 23:50.520
or do you assume your father's position?

23:52.000 --> 23:55.720
Well, I, a time or two, discussed the

23:55.720 --> 23:59.420
subject but we both have our own opinions

23:59.420 --> 24:02.180
so we just, I mean I found out their,

24:02.240 --> 24:06.460
their sentiments and just sort of left it

24:06.460 --> 24:09.340
at that. But do you find that you

24:09.340 --> 24:12.140
generally disagree on the goals of the

24:12.140 --> 24:14.420
movement or on the means of the movement?

24:14.660 --> 24:18.080
It's mostly on the means. The idea, the

24:18.080 --> 24:20.260
disagreement and the feeling most of my

24:20.260 --> 24:23.400
family, my mother's side of the family.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.140
Because my father's side of the family I

24:25.140 --> 24:28.040
never see. But their feeling is mostly

24:28.040 --> 24:30.020
that it's being pushed too hard. Of

24:30.020 --> 24:31.100
course, they're also cold water

24:31.100 --> 24:34.560
conservatives, so. I mean, they're just

24:34.560 --> 24:36.920
very conservative on the whole thing and

24:36.920 --> 24:39.120
they think that it's being pushed and that

24:39.120 --> 24:41.920
you just can't do it that way, that you

24:41.920 --> 24:44.120
just kind of let it gradually happen over

24:44.120 --> 24:48.080
several hundred years, I guess. Well, if

24:48.080 --> 24:50.060
someone were just to come up and ask you

24:50.060 --> 24:52.620
point blank, what is your opinion of the

24:52.620 --> 24:57.000
Civil Rights Movement? Are you in favor of

24:57.000 --> 24:58.680
it or not in favor of it? how would you

24:58.680 --> 25:01.240
answer? I would say that I was in favor of

25:01.240 --> 25:04.400
it, yeah. And in terms of the means of the

25:04.400 --> 25:04.680
movement?

25:07.900 --> 25:10.740
Generally, I agree with it. I mean, like I

25:10.740 --> 25:14.760
said, I have disagreements with it, but on

25:14.760 --> 25:18.720
a whole, I think it's, it seemed in the

25:18.720 --> 25:20.980
right direction. And do you have any

25:23.500 --> 25:26.520
opinions or pictures of the kind of people

25:26.520 --> 25:28.080
that are involved in the civil civil

25:28.080 --> 25:30.680
rights movement that I impress you either

25:30.680 --> 25:35.580
favorably or disfavorably? Well, now I

25:35.580 --> 25:37.840
have several different impressions. I

25:37.840 --> 25:41.200
mean, I think that, well, I'm sure that

25:41.200 --> 25:44.280
there are people who are, most of the

25:44.280 --> 25:47.200
people are very sincerely believe in it

25:47.200 --> 25:50.220
and are very working hard to do what they

25:50.220 --> 25:52.260
think is best. I think there are

25:52.260 --> 25:55.580
unfortunately those who who are sort of in

25:55.580 --> 25:57.820
it to see what, you know, for a little bit

25:57.820 --> 26:00.120
of excitement or because it's the thing to

26:00.120 --> 26:03.140
do or to cause a little trouble or

26:03.140 --> 26:05.580
something. But I think on the whole, it's

26:05.580 --> 26:08.360
those people who really mean well and who

26:08.360 --> 26:12.840
are trying to do as best they can. Well,

26:12.900 --> 26:18.180
in terms of values and commitment and such

26:18.180 --> 26:20.060
toward the situation, how would you think

26:20.060 --> 26:22.000
that these people, specifically the ones

26:22.000 --> 26:24.600
you know, have gone south would differ

26:24.600 --> 26:29.280
from you? Well, among other things,

26:32.960 --> 26:35.260
they probably just feel a little more

26:35.260 --> 26:37.100
personally involved in the situation,

26:37.300 --> 26:39.280
enough to go down there. I mean, it is

26:39.280 --> 26:44.120
sort of a long ways from here. And I tend

26:44.120 --> 26:47.200
to be a little apathetic. And I think that

26:47.200 --> 26:49.060
they're just more vitally interested in

26:49.060 --> 26:51.320
it, enough to really run down there and do

26:51.320 --> 26:54.820
something. What risks... Oh, I'm sorry, go

26:54.820 --> 26:58.500
ahead. Oh, go ahead. I forgot. I'm sorry

26:58.500 --> 27:00.960
for interrupting you. What risks do you

27:00.960 --> 27:02.760
think would be involved in going to the

27:02.760 --> 27:02.960
site?

27:07.620 --> 27:13.140
Well, now the risk would... Well, there

27:13.140 --> 27:14.380
have been a few people disappeared,

27:14.540 --> 27:17.020
although I think that's... I mean, I think

27:17.020 --> 27:20.120
that's sort of one or two instances. I

27:20.120 --> 27:21.900
don't think that, I don't really think

27:21.900 --> 27:24.200
that I would expect to be shot when I was

27:24.200 --> 27:28.560
down there. But, um, there is of course

27:28.560 --> 27:30.300
the risk of being thrown in jail, the risk

27:30.300 --> 27:33.260
of running into a lot of antagonism and a

27:33.260 --> 27:39.360
lot of ill feeling. But I don't, maybe

27:39.360 --> 27:41.700
getting a rock thrown at you or something.

27:41.700 --> 27:47.740
but I don't think there's any huge risk as

27:47.740 --> 27:52.920
far as personal

27:52.920 --> 27:57.980
injury or anything. The risk I don't think

27:57.980 --> 28:02.240
as a person is too great. Do you think the

28:02.240 --> 28:05.160
possibility of physical violence to your

28:05.160 --> 28:08.020
person, of discomfort in terms of living

28:08.020 --> 28:10.520
conditions or possibly being arrested of

28:10.520 --> 28:13.220
the erratic schedule that a civil rights

28:13.220 --> 28:14.840
worker would have to keep. Do you think

28:14.840 --> 28:19.620
that these factors would be any sort of a

28:19.620 --> 28:23.200
strong influence toward making you decide

28:23.200 --> 28:26.240
not to go? Well, I'd consider them if I

28:26.240 --> 28:28.600
thought that they were factors. I think

28:28.600 --> 28:34.340
that, I mean, there would be hardships. I

28:34.340 --> 28:36.540
might have to sleep in the car or

28:36.540 --> 28:41.240
something. But I think that that wouldn't

28:41.240 --> 28:44.560
be the main thing I'd consider. What would

28:44.560 --> 28:46.200
be the main thing? Whether or not I could

28:46.200 --> 28:48.340
really, it would really be worth my while

28:48.340 --> 28:51.680
to go down there. I mean, if I thought I

28:51.680 --> 28:53.280
was going to get shot at, I really don't

28:53.280 --> 28:55.500
think I'd go, because I don't particularly

28:55.500 --> 28:57.720
want to dodge bullets, but I don't think

28:57.720 --> 29:00.300
that's the case. And I think the

29:00.300 --> 29:02.040
consideration would be more whether or not

29:02.040 --> 29:04.580
I could do something once I got there.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.200
Well, you just stated that one of your

29:08.200 --> 29:09.740
main considerations would be whether or

29:09.740 --> 29:11.840
not it would be worth your while to go.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.420
Now, what do you think you personally

29:14.420 --> 29:16.720
could derive from the situation?

29:19.440 --> 29:22.080
Well, that I think that I could contribute

29:22.080 --> 29:24.880
something. It would be worth something

29:24.880 --> 29:26.800
that I could do here. It would be worth

29:26.800 --> 29:28.920
leaving what I'm doing here to go down if

29:28.920 --> 29:32.220
I thought I could contribute more there

29:32.220 --> 29:38.560
and in terms of you know the time I lose

29:38.560 --> 29:40.060
here if I thought I could contribute

29:40.060 --> 29:45.040
something valuable enough in relation to

29:45.040 --> 29:49.780
to what I lose by spending some time down

29:49.780 --> 29:52.740
there. What would you lose by spending

29:52.740 --> 29:56.660
time down there? Well I'd lose either well

29:56.660 --> 29:58.240
Well, actually, I'd lose money if I were

29:58.240 --> 30:03.200
working, or time in school, plus all the

30:03.200 --> 30:08.020
trouble of getting there. Anything that

30:08.020 --> 30:11.320
would... I mean, it is a long ways away.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.960
And just the whole trouble of getting

30:13.960 --> 30:16.520
ready and going and leaving whatever I

30:16.520 --> 30:19.060
might be doing here. I don't know. It

30:19.060 --> 30:20.700
would depend on what I was doing at the

30:20.700 --> 30:25.500
time, what I'd miss. Now is there any

30:25.500 --> 30:26.900
statement that you'd like to make

30:26.900 --> 30:29.720
concerning civil rights that I have not

30:29.720 --> 30:34.360
asked you about? Not that I can think of.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.000
Alrighty, well thank you very much for

30:37.000 --> 30:38.100
your time. I appreciate it.
