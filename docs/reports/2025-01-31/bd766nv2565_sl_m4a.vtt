WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
The information and the way you train

00:03.280 --> 00:05.280
other people is to give up the

00:05.280 --> 00:08.380
information. If that is so, then that's

00:08.380 --> 00:09.900
what the whole purpose of this meeting is,

00:09.920 --> 00:12.120
this leadership. It's that we're going to

00:12.120 --> 00:16.140
give you all the information we have. And

00:16.140 --> 00:18.000
also, a little later, I'll explain it to

00:18.000 --> 00:20.840
you. The program of the day today, the

00:20.840 --> 00:24.720
first thing I want to do is you already

00:24.720 --> 00:26.760
have information. I'm going to wait until

00:26.760 --> 00:29.120
you discuss that in a moment. I'm

00:29.120 --> 00:31.000
circulating two different sheets. One is

00:31.000 --> 00:33.480
your earliest availability to go south.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.540
And I know that you have problems flying

00:36.540 --> 00:39.040
over. So you want to be careful where you

00:39.040 --> 00:41.780
go. But you have your earliest

00:41.780 --> 00:44.540
availability. That's on the sheet that

00:44.540 --> 00:46.460
says, Littleman got earliest availability.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.900
And then there's another sheet going

00:48.900 --> 00:51.580
around that says the percentage of cars.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.840
And we want to know if you have a car,

00:54.940 --> 00:57.040
what its capacity is, and when you're

00:57.040 --> 00:59.500
leaving. So they'll be making their ways

00:59.500 --> 01:02.220
around. We'll get to that later this

01:02.220 --> 01:05.640
afternoon. We're going to give you an

01:05.640 --> 01:09.260
opportunity to ask some questions about

01:09.260 --> 01:12.020
Wavelength and the home of the group. And

01:12.020 --> 01:13.260
then a little bit later in the morning,

01:13.380 --> 01:15.760
we're going to have a panel put together

01:15.760 --> 01:20.920
of people, veterans related to having

01:20.920 --> 01:24.200
recently returned from the South. and to

01:24.200 --> 01:27.080
talk about the problems of regular

01:27.080 --> 01:31.640
abortion in southern communities. There

01:31.640 --> 01:33.120
are a lot of people who have not yet been

01:33.120 --> 01:35.140
interviewed, and we're aware of this, and

01:35.140 --> 01:36.480
our interview committee and screening

01:36.480 --> 01:39.960
committee is too. What we will ask you to

01:39.960 --> 01:43.100
do at the lunch break, instead of taking a

01:43.100 --> 01:44.940
normal one hour, we'll take one hour and a

01:44.940 --> 01:46.540
half, and we'll go through a 12-minute

01:46.540 --> 01:48.800
interview. Those of you who have not yet

01:48.800 --> 01:51.100
been interviewed, we'll just say right

01:51.100 --> 01:52.060
there on that screen,

02:04.180 --> 02:07.020
The orientation program will be designed

02:07.020 --> 02:10.220
to familiarize you with Mississippi, the

02:10.220 --> 02:13.260
people who are in the party and the

02:13.260 --> 02:15.840
planned summer programs. At the

02:15.840 --> 02:17.920
orientation session, you will be assigned

02:17.920 --> 02:20.220
to particular counties in which you will

02:20.220 --> 02:22.540
work and will meet the Mississippi people

02:22.540 --> 02:25.280
with whom you will be working. At the

02:25.280 --> 02:27.400
orientation session, a final decision on

02:27.400 --> 02:30.260
your acceptance will be made, for the MFDP

02:30.260 --> 02:32.860
must attempt to avoid all of the trouble

02:32.860 --> 02:35.600
possible for Mississippi. It's still a

02:35.600 --> 02:38.060
dangerous place. This does not pertain to

02:38.060 --> 02:41.480
you. You see, they're also dealing with

02:41.480 --> 02:43.400
lots of people individually all over the

02:43.400 --> 02:45.220
country, and Canada for that matter, too.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.660
If you've been screened up here, you've

02:48.660 --> 02:51.700
been accepted down. The session will be

02:51.700 --> 02:53.420
held at the Gulfside Methodist Assembly

02:53.420 --> 02:55.260
Waveland, Mississippi on the Gulf Coast.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.900
Travel directions are included. The

02:57.900 --> 02:59.880
orientation will start at 2 p.m. Thursday,

03:00.120 --> 03:02.920
June 10th. An evening meal will be served.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.260
The session will end Tuesday, June 15th

03:05.260 --> 03:07.600
after breakfast, at which time you will go

03:07.600 --> 03:09.460
to the county where you will be working.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.020
If at all possible, bring a sleeping bag

03:12.020 --> 03:14.620
for some people who may need it. We are

03:14.620 --> 03:16.780
also asking you to bring $25 to help us

03:16.780 --> 03:21.540
defray the expense of the session. It

03:21.540 --> 03:23.700
costs $5 a day to house and feed each

03:23.700 --> 03:26.060
volunteer. I'll explain that in a moment.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.620
The MFDP has almost no money at all now.

03:31.180 --> 03:33.080
This also means that we must ask you to

03:33.080 --> 03:34.500
provide your own transportation to

03:34.500 --> 03:37.540
Waveland. Speaking of money, we must ask

03:37.540 --> 03:39.120
that you provide your own subsistence for

03:39.120 --> 03:41.580
the summer. This means about $15 per week.

03:42.340 --> 03:44.060
housing will be arranged for you with

03:44.060 --> 03:46.580
people living in the county in regards to

03:46.580 --> 03:48.140
housing you must not expect facilities

03:48.140 --> 03:50.760
that you are probably used to this means

03:50.760 --> 03:52.460
that there may be no indoor plumbing no

03:52.460 --> 03:56.880
running water no hot water but the people

03:56.880 --> 03:59.540
you stay with will more than make up for

03:59.540 --> 04:02.020
the lack of facilities you should bring

04:02.020 --> 04:03.540
comfortable summer clothing to wear and

04:03.540 --> 04:05.260
unless you want to go to church you will

04:05.260 --> 04:08.500
not need dress clothing at all you should

04:08.500 --> 04:10.140
avoid bringing a lot of baggage because

04:10.140 --> 04:12.880
you will probably not need it and a lot of

04:12.880 --> 04:14.480
baggage will be difficult to carry around

04:14.480 --> 04:16.460
you should also bring your own personal

04:16.460 --> 04:19.040
items such as toilet articles or some

04:19.040 --> 04:21.260
point for in some places they may not be

04:21.260 --> 04:24.800
easily gotten if possible you should bring

04:24.800 --> 04:26.860
a typewriter typing paper carbon paper

04:27.440 --> 04:29.540
also if you are able to bring a car at all

04:29.540 --> 04:31.880
please do you have a tremendous lack of

04:31.880 --> 04:33.860
transportation not only in jackson but in

04:33.860 --> 04:36.920
all also in other counties if you do bring

04:36.920 --> 04:38.380
a car you should try to be able to cover

04:38.380 --> 04:41.900
operating expenses you should know that

04:41.900 --> 04:43.980
the mississippi law requires license

04:43.980 --> 04:46.300
mississippi license plates after 60 days

04:46.300 --> 04:49.020
in the state the tax costs four percent of

04:49.020 --> 04:52.480
the estimated value of the car the last

04:52.480 --> 04:55.000
thing we should mention is bail contacts

04:55.000 --> 04:57.920
there may be some trouble with quote

04:57.920 --> 05:01.860
mississippi officials unquote for the mfdp

05:01.860 --> 05:05.400
has not yet quote reached unquote them we

05:07.980 --> 05:09.940
We expect less trouble with them this

05:09.940 --> 05:11.480
summer than last, but a chance still

05:11.480 --> 05:13.700
remains that you may enjoy the local

05:13.700 --> 05:17.380
government's hospitality. We would like to

05:17.380 --> 05:20.360
know a few people we can contact for bond

05:20.360 --> 05:22.920
money. $500 will be sufficient in case you

05:22.920 --> 05:26.620
are arrested. We will have good legal help

05:26.620 --> 05:29.820
for you if this problem comes up. It is

05:29.820 --> 05:31.220
very important you attend the orientation

05:31.220 --> 05:34.900
session. what you will be doing will be

05:34.900 --> 05:36.900
discussed and you will have a chance to

05:36.900 --> 05:39.440
talk to the people with whom you will be

05:39.440 --> 05:43.320
working. That one, it should have stayed

05:43.320 --> 05:44.760
the last semester, whatever they want.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.520
Now this then is the detail of what the

05:51.520 --> 05:54.360
rest of the information from Waveland. The

05:54.360 --> 05:56.240
first two pages give you an idea of the

05:56.240 --> 05:58.640
counties in Mississippi which will have

05:58.640 --> 06:02.000
programs this summer. some of the numbers

06:02.000 --> 06:04.780
of people they will be needing. And we

06:04.780 --> 06:06.300
purposely reprinted the whole thing,

06:06.320 --> 06:10.640
although it might not all be useful to

06:10.640 --> 06:12.140
you. But just to give you an idea of what

06:12.140 --> 06:16.280
the range of projects are, all the way

06:16.280 --> 06:19.800
from, you see, sewing to adult education,

06:20.060 --> 06:22.500
voter registration, and so on. And these

06:22.500 --> 06:24.360
are for you to keep if you like. The total

06:24.360 --> 06:26.160
number of volunteers, that's for the whole

06:26.160 --> 06:29.380
country, It will be 439, and then like

06:29.380 --> 06:33.080
about 150 from here. We have,

06:33.140 --> 06:36.340
incidentally, over 100 that are not yet

06:36.340 --> 06:41.580
assigned and probably go. This is the rest

06:41.580 --> 06:42.960
of the next two pages of transportation

06:42.960 --> 06:43.480
information.

06:47.060 --> 06:49.140
And you'll see the reason for

06:49.140 --> 06:51.220
transportation coming from New Orleans if

06:51.220 --> 06:52.720
you'll turn to the next to the last page,

06:52.900 --> 06:54.100
because the map is there.

07:01.860 --> 07:08.140
New Orleans is your best or fastest way to

07:08.140 --> 07:11.540
go if you're coming from out here. Highway

07:11.540 --> 07:15.720
90 is that major scenic highway that

07:15.720 --> 07:18.160
follows the Gulf Coast, Florida, if you're

07:18.160 --> 07:19.340
driving from New Orleans.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.360
and some of the information I just read to

07:25.360 --> 07:26.880
you from that letter is contained on the

07:26.880 --> 07:27.980
last page

07:34.760 --> 07:36.900
now what I'd like to do is stop here right

07:36.900 --> 07:41.180
here and talk about it. Yes.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.620
Yeah. We've discussed this with SNCC

07:51.620 --> 07:55.420
regional people. We urge you not to go to

07:55.420 --> 07:58.400
Washington, but if you can get down here

07:58.400 --> 07:59.800
faster to go to Mississippi.

08:03.520 --> 08:08.040
If you're going what? You mean to visit

08:08.040 --> 08:10.280
family? And what's the question?

08:13.900 --> 08:16.720
And get back down here as quick as you can

08:16.720 --> 08:21.540
to Mississippi. Yeah. Unless you happen to

08:21.540 --> 08:23.240
be living in Washington. We have one

08:23.240 --> 08:26.480
that's very close. What do you think,

08:26.480 --> 08:31.260
Mike? Where are you? Yeah. If you're that

08:31.260 --> 08:31.600
close.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.460
Not unless it works out that the person

08:57.460 --> 08:59.000
sitting on this side of the room right now

08:59.000 --> 09:01.340
is jotting down in his piece of paper that

09:01.340 --> 09:03.700
I have a car leaving from New York on June

09:03.700 --> 09:08.120
19th. We have no way of working this out.

09:08.360 --> 09:12.060
Yeah? They may have cars.

09:15.020 --> 09:18.700
You have a... Do you know the address

09:18.700 --> 09:19.060
offhand?

09:25.700 --> 09:26.340
Okay.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.480
In other words, if you will be arriving in

09:39.480 --> 09:43.040
Mississippi after the 15th? No, you put

09:43.040 --> 09:44.240
that down on the sheet that's coming

09:44.240 --> 09:47.140
around, and what we're going to suggest to

09:47.140 --> 09:50.000
Mississippi people is that all of you

09:50.000 --> 09:52.560
people go directly to Jackson, to their

09:52.560 --> 09:54.400
central office, and then be assigned from

09:54.400 --> 09:55.240
there around the state.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.400
You got one separately? Yeah. Yeah.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.980
Well, if you've been... Have you been

10:16.980 --> 10:18.780
interviewed here? Yeah. Then you've been

10:18.780 --> 10:20.920
accepted in the Mississippi project,

10:21.040 --> 10:22.400
right? There are a few people who wrote

10:22.400 --> 10:25.480
independently of this next screening

10:25.480 --> 10:27.300
process up here, and they heard

10:27.300 --> 10:29.680
independently themselves. But they sent us

10:29.680 --> 10:30.360
a list of your names.

10:34.100 --> 10:38.100
Well, because they need the people down

10:38.100 --> 10:40.400
here right quick, and we haven't even been

10:40.400 --> 10:42.740
able to honor the needs of one or two of

10:42.740 --> 10:45.660
the small counties that have needs right

10:45.660 --> 10:48.460
now, so that it doesn't seem to make sense

10:48.460 --> 10:51.660
to go clear east and spend a week or two

10:51.660 --> 10:53.860
doing that when they need people right now

10:53.860 --> 10:54.200
in Mississippi.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.100
Well, we're going to suggest that there be

11:04.100 --> 11:05.940
an orientation, but I think that they will

11:05.940 --> 11:08.260
probably not be able to organize another

11:08.260 --> 11:09.800
statewide one, but there will be an

11:09.800 --> 11:13.240
orientation at your local project. It

11:13.240 --> 11:14.620
won't be as an elaborate one as this.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.400
I would suggest you give your two weeks

11:30.400 --> 11:30.680
notice.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.500
I'll bring the 400 with you.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.660
Or a car. Let me just see if I show a

11:43.660 --> 11:46.480
hand. How many do have cars? Oh, that's

11:46.480 --> 11:49.780
great. I mean that are going south. Cars

11:49.780 --> 11:50.320
are going south.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.520
We're going to get the Arkansas people

11:58.520 --> 12:03.320
together. Is Vince here someplace? During

12:03.320 --> 12:06.900
the lunch period, Vince, why don't you

12:06.900 --> 12:08.600
stand up so the other Arkansas people can

12:08.600 --> 12:12.920
see. This is Vincent O'Connor. During

12:12.920 --> 12:15.240
lunch, let's get the Arkansas people

12:15.240 --> 12:19.060
together down here. Okay? Okay, with this,

12:19.060 --> 12:22.140
down in this corner right here. And we'll

12:22.140 --> 12:24.660
work separately on transportation and what

12:24.660 --> 12:26.300
we report to and all this stuff over

12:26.300 --> 12:27.140
there. Yes.

12:31.820 --> 12:36.660
Have already what? Yes. Yes. Yes, let me

12:36.660 --> 12:39.060
see how many Arkansas people are there.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.680
Just put your hands up so I can count.

12:41.140 --> 12:46.580
One, two, three, four. Four. Okay, ten

12:46.580 --> 12:49.780
people were selected for Arkansas. They

12:49.780 --> 12:51.960
did their own, we sent them a whole batch

12:51.960 --> 12:53.660
of applications. They pulled out of it

12:53.660 --> 12:55.760
what they thought were their needs, and

12:55.760 --> 12:57.680
then they wrote directly to these people

12:57.680 --> 13:00.600
accepting them. Since then, we've had a

13:00.600 --> 13:02.440
little bit of attrition. I think we lost a

13:02.440 --> 13:05.720
few via the marriage route and other ways.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.060
So we're going to have to replace them. If

13:08.060 --> 13:10.640
somebody has a particular driving need,

13:10.720 --> 13:13.240
they want to go to Arkansas, So you can

13:13.240 --> 13:14.740
tell me about it during the lunch period.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.700
Otherwise, we're just going to be

13:16.700 --> 13:19.520
selecting people for you have some. So all

13:19.520 --> 13:19.780
right.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.600
There are four people left last week for,

13:26.740 --> 13:30.780
I think, Carroll County. That's on the

13:30.780 --> 13:33.320
sheet someplace, I'm sure. And a couple

13:33.320 --> 13:35.840
have gone off to other practice, other

13:35.840 --> 13:38.360
kinds of work a little bit earlier. And

13:38.360 --> 13:42.520
then we also lost a few to CORE and SLCC

13:42.520 --> 13:44.220
because we did not have enough definite

13:44.220 --> 13:45.940
information about summer projects and

13:45.940 --> 13:48.320
people had to make commitments, but that's

13:48.320 --> 13:48.820
not a loss.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.620
Let me just see by a show of hands so we

13:56.620 --> 13:58.160
all know ourselves. How many can make

13:58.160 --> 13:59.380
Waveland on June 10th?

14:03.820 --> 14:07.680
Yeah, 10 or 12. So can anybody, those who,

14:07.760 --> 14:10.000
just keep your hands down. How about other

14:10.000 --> 14:12.260
people that can make part of Waveland, say

14:12.260 --> 14:13.640
the 13th or the 15th?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.620
Oh, that's pretty soon.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.940
You're all young people driving all night?

14:31.520 --> 14:32.680
A day plus.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.960
You start at 8 o'clock one morning. You

14:42.960 --> 14:44.520
should make it 6 o'clock the next night.

14:50.060 --> 14:50.880
Day and a half.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.040
Yes, that's the 1.30. It's recession

14:57.040 --> 14:58.000
today. I'm going to try to arrange it

14:58.000 --> 14:58.200
properly.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.360
Yeah, 24, 12, 36 hours.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.360
I don't know what it is with you people.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.580
I've driven to Iowa in that time.

15:17.840 --> 15:18.260
Further?

15:22.440 --> 15:29.800
Maybe that's why. Two days. Uh, 36 hours.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.960
Uh, you got a lot of money to spend on the

15:32.960 --> 15:33.480
station here.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.220
Well, some people do. What's the distance?

15:39.320 --> 15:42.180
Does anybody know? Um, I think I'm gonna

15:42.180 --> 15:45.580
say it's... 2,000? 1,700 miles to Selma

15:45.580 --> 15:48.560
Station. How much? 1,700 miles to Selma

15:48.560 --> 15:52.660
Station. That's the minimum, sir. Yeah,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.520
but that's further east, isn't it? Yeah,

15:54.520 --> 15:57.720
that's north of that. I would say about 2

15:57.720 --> 16:01.900
,000 miles. 2,000 miles. Yeah, that's what

16:01.900 --> 16:04.660
I figured, about 2,000 miles. Yeah.

16:07.680 --> 16:13.340
Make 1,000 miles a day. Yeah. Why is

16:13.340 --> 16:15.320
Mississippi asking for 130 volunteers?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.540
Well, as it works out, we seem to be the

16:21.540 --> 16:23.120
only ones, or at least the only ones we

16:23.120 --> 16:25.720
know about that are this well organized

16:25.720 --> 16:31.140
quote unquote so they you know we told

16:31.140 --> 16:36.300
them we'd have about 150. i think a lot of

16:36.300 --> 16:39.780
people have written directly to them and

16:39.780 --> 16:41.400
so they're dealing with a lot of people

16:41.400 --> 16:43.140
individually but they're counting on us

16:43.140 --> 16:44.300
for one large patch

16:48.440 --> 16:51.700
and has been interviewed right

16:53.660 --> 16:55.940
oh we made the assumption in your case

16:55.940 --> 16:58.860
that you're both are both good screen

16:58.860 --> 17:00.340
you're going to go together

17:06.950 --> 17:08.760
any other questions are wavelength

17:14.300 --> 17:16.780
all right uh phase two then for this

17:16.780 --> 17:19.300
morning is to uh get this panel together

17:19.300 --> 17:23.820
and uh talk about uh problems of living

17:23.820 --> 17:26.080
there now what we intend to do here is uh

17:26.080 --> 17:29.420
bring this people this group of people

17:29.420 --> 17:33.600
forward and uh give them all a minute or

17:33.600 --> 17:36.580
two to just open up areas that we'll get

17:36.580 --> 17:40.260
into in some depth but a lot of it will be

17:40.260 --> 17:43.640
in response to what your questions are too

17:43.640 --> 17:47.580
of this panel and uh you'll i'll introduce

17:47.580 --> 17:49.920
the panel to you uh very briefly but it'll

17:49.920 --> 17:52.100
give you an idea of what they have to

17:52.100 --> 17:55.020
offer to you let me first call up frank

17:55.020 --> 17:59.700
vitts and frank powell who are working up

17:59.700 --> 18:00.520
north

18:03.460 --> 18:08.620
who are from alabama and I'll tell you

18:08.620 --> 18:12.440
about life in Alabama. Ron Bridgeforth

18:12.440 --> 18:17.120
from Secretary of Defense. What happened

18:17.120 --> 18:20.940
to Ron? I think he must be standing

18:20.940 --> 18:23.080
outside or something. Is Doug Smith here?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.940
He was due with him, so maybe he went to

18:26.940 --> 18:30.860
get him or something. Kathy Kappen, who

18:30.860 --> 18:33.320
spent about seven months, And then, of all

18:33.320 --> 18:34.660
things, got married and went back to

18:34.660 --> 18:35.960
Mississippi recently on a honeymoon.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.100
Mike Miller, regional coordinator of SNCC

18:43.100 --> 18:50.720
in this area. Neil Friedman, who is with

18:50.720 --> 18:53.660
our screening committee at Langley Porter,

18:54.340 --> 18:56.240
some colleges, and will be teaching at a

18:56.240 --> 18:57.800
certain Negro college this year.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.580
And that's it for the moment. We'll wait

19:06.580 --> 19:09.160
for Ron, and when Ron and Doug come, they

19:09.160 --> 19:12.560
can just join us. Thank you.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.640
Doug, you want to come up here, please?

19:48.640 --> 19:50.940
Doug Smith is the 5th Congressional

19:50.940 --> 19:53.080
District Program Director for Snake and

19:53.080 --> 19:53.360
Mississippi.

19:59.780 --> 20:01.820
And Ron, I think it would be good if you

20:01.820 --> 20:03.820
would sort of kick things off and get out

20:03.820 --> 20:04.240
of your way here.

20:25.560 --> 20:29.420
Well, the man just said, tell you what it

20:29.420 --> 20:32.260
is, I live in Mississippi. And that's

20:32.260 --> 20:35.360
somewhat impossible. I mean you run into

20:35.360 --> 20:38.360
maybe, well you run into orientations in

20:38.360 --> 20:40.880
Waveland and come late probably one in

20:40.880 --> 20:43.900
Jackson. There were two orientations in

20:43.900 --> 20:48.840
Oxford, Ohio last summer. And people try

20:48.840 --> 20:53.860
to talk about, and will try to talk about

20:53.860 --> 20:56.420
what it's like to be in Mississippi and

20:56.420 --> 20:57.500
work on voter registration.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.140
Now I'll start off by saying you can't be

21:02.140 --> 21:03.680
prepared for that. I mean it's a different

21:03.680 --> 21:04.040
world.

21:06.740 --> 21:09.440
It's like, you might not like policemen

21:09.440 --> 21:11.760
now, but at least you can ask them for

21:11.760 --> 21:12.060
directions.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.040
And like people are going to attempt to

21:18.040 --> 21:19.680
scare the hell out of you so you don't go

21:19.680 --> 21:22.180
around the highways at 70 and 80 miles an

21:22.180 --> 21:24.240
hour before you learn what it's all about.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.380
and God, I hope you don't.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.880
You're going to run into people that

21:30.880 --> 21:34.400
really hate your guts. I mean, they'd

21:34.400 --> 21:36.220
rather see me, because at least I'm black,

21:36.420 --> 21:38.800
but you're a traitor. You're a traitor to

21:38.800 --> 21:41.540
the white race and white supremacy. And

21:41.540 --> 21:43.980
they look at it in those terms. You're

21:43.980 --> 21:45.820
going to run into very scared southern

21:45.820 --> 21:48.900
white men who have their backs against the

21:48.900 --> 21:52.000
wall, whose very way of life and existence

21:52.460 --> 21:55.300
I mean, is being torn away from you. The

21:55.300 --> 21:56.860
foundation of their lives is the Southern

21:56.860 --> 22:02.000
Negro. And he's standing up. He's being

22:02.000 --> 22:03.420
laid down all his life, and they've been

22:03.420 --> 22:05.480
standing on his back, and suddenly he's

22:05.480 --> 22:08.180
beginning to stand up. And what do they

22:08.180 --> 22:12.860
do? They have to follow. I mean, Baldwin

22:12.860 --> 22:14.660
articulates that whole situation very

22:14.660 --> 22:16.840
well, in terms of walking out in the

22:16.840 --> 22:18.260
morning and seeing the whole sky in

22:18.260 --> 22:20.760
flames. I mean, it destroys your grasp

22:20.760 --> 22:23.180
upon reality. And these men are very

22:23.180 --> 22:24.440
scared. They're fighting back like a

22:24.440 --> 22:27.020
corner cat in a corner. He's going to

22:27.020 --> 22:28.440
start striking me out any way possible,

22:28.680 --> 22:29.960
just out of fear.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.940
And during the years of 61, 60, 61, 62,

22:37.160 --> 22:42.400
63, there wasn't much in the way of

22:42.400 --> 22:44.020
stopping that man from just striking me

22:44.020 --> 22:45.420
out and hitting people and killing people.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.800
Because of last summer, and because of the

22:48.800 --> 22:51.460
virtual challenges going on now, he's also

22:51.460 --> 22:55.240
become very image conscious. So it's a bit

22:55.240 --> 22:56.740
safer than last summer. I mean, he doesn't

22:56.740 --> 22:57.860
want any trouble. He doesn't want...I

22:57.860 --> 22:59.120
mean, sheriffs don't want to be Sheriff

22:59.120 --> 23:02.420
Rainey all over again. So, I mean, they're

23:02.420 --> 23:04.280
kind of backing up. And they're being

23:04.280 --> 23:05.860
pushed farther and farther with this stuff

23:05.860 --> 23:08.940
now. And they're trying things like now to

23:08.940 --> 23:11.140
get you on every charge they can. and

23:11.140 --> 23:12.280
they're going to get you to contribute to

23:12.280 --> 23:14.760
the Lincoln C4-1 account, you're just

23:14.760 --> 23:17.340
going to have to watch yourself. And sure,

23:17.360 --> 23:18.540
they'll make deals here and there, and

23:18.540 --> 23:20.060
say, well, we'll give you 10 years and you

23:20.060 --> 23:23.640
leave the state of Alabama. You've got a

23:23.640 --> 23:24.200
choice, you know.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.160
But that should be told again and again.

23:29.980 --> 23:31.980
And fear is a good, healthy thing. It

23:31.980 --> 23:35.880
keeps you alive. And I'd say now, if

23:35.880 --> 23:38.260
you're not afraid, and you feel no fear,

23:38.500 --> 23:40.740
don't go. because there's something wrong.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.220
I think the attitude to go in with is that

23:49.220 --> 23:51.840
you don't know and you don't have the

23:51.840 --> 23:55.400
answers. At least not the answers, because

23:55.400 --> 23:57.840
I don't know if there's the answers. And

23:57.840 --> 23:59.220
those people are going to basically do

23:59.220 --> 24:02.180
what they want to do. They know what they

24:02.180 --> 24:04.220
want. Maybe it's not what you think they

24:04.220 --> 24:07.180
need, but they know what they want. and

24:07.180 --> 24:08.480
you're going in with the attitude of

24:08.480 --> 24:11.500
helping them to get it. And if you can't

24:11.500 --> 24:13.860
agree to that, then you should leave, I

24:13.860 --> 24:17.620
think. Because you're not going down there

24:17.620 --> 24:19.500
to sell your line and propagate what you

24:19.500 --> 24:22.740
believe. But you're going down there to

24:22.740 --> 24:25.200
help those people do what they're trying

24:25.200 --> 24:27.540
to do. Maybe you bring in some outside

24:27.540 --> 24:28.780
knowledge, some outside skills.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.480
And if you think you know a better way of

24:33.480 --> 24:36.140
doing something, say it. don't try to make

24:36.140 --> 24:38.360
them do it. I mean that's just, you can't

24:38.360 --> 24:39.820
make people do things in the first place.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.000
You don't have that much influence and you

24:42.000 --> 24:45.380
just create confusion. There'll be a lot

24:45.380 --> 24:47.600
of situations where you find that because

24:47.600 --> 24:50.100
you are Northern White and with college

24:50.100 --> 24:52.260
backgrounds, people tend to be intimidated

24:52.260 --> 24:55.700
by that. And you'll have to deal with that

24:55.700 --> 24:58.020
when you get to that. Sometimes you find

24:58.020 --> 25:00.600
that you can't talk. I mean you simply

25:00.600 --> 25:02.940
can't talk until other people express what

25:02.940 --> 25:05.060
they believe. Because if you talk first,

25:05.380 --> 25:07.980
then they're too intimidating to talk.

25:08.860 --> 25:12.460
Because you become like God, you know, the

25:12.460 --> 25:14.580
Savior, which you know you're not.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.800
There are a lot of other things that

25:21.800 --> 25:23.500
become a lot touchier, like the

25:23.500 --> 25:25.140
relationship of you related to Slick's

25:25.140 --> 25:30.740
staff. Slick is basically black. It's

25:30.740 --> 25:34.400
black oil. to propagate black leadership,

25:34.640 --> 25:39.680
which is not such a bad thing. But you

25:39.680 --> 25:41.720
find almost a reversal of what you find

25:41.720 --> 25:44.440
with southern white men. You find black

25:44.440 --> 25:49.040
sharpness and black supremacy. And last

25:49.040 --> 25:53.120
summer at Oxford, the volunteers saw a

25:53.120 --> 25:55.040
very weird thing. They saw people who had

25:55.040 --> 25:56.700
been running across Mississippi for three

25:56.700 --> 25:58.840
years, going through all sorts of hell,

25:58.840 --> 26:02.280
little scared out of their wits for a

26:02.280 --> 26:07.440
number of reasons. One, they were afraid

26:07.440 --> 26:09.460
of the responsibility of 750 white

26:09.460 --> 26:12.060
volunteers and trying to keep them alive.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.600
And two, some of them were afraid of being

26:15.600 --> 26:18.780
overrun by white intellectuals.

26:21.180 --> 26:25.000
But you're two very valid figures. And

26:25.000 --> 26:25.960
they didn't know how to deal with that.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.600
And a great number of the volunteers felt

26:31.600 --> 26:34.960
like they were shut out and isolated. That

26:34.960 --> 26:37.260
they weren't talked to. That people

26:37.260 --> 26:40.380
wouldn't tell them what was going on. And

26:40.380 --> 26:43.440
I thought this. It's a closed, cold, cold

26:43.440 --> 26:45.640
staff meeting. Well, hell, I'm a project

26:45.640 --> 26:47.500
director. But you're not state staff,

26:47.580 --> 26:50.100
you're not court staff. It became a very,

26:50.140 --> 26:54.780
you know, it's all they had. A lot of that

26:54.780 --> 26:56.160
is broken down, but still you're going to

26:56.160 --> 26:59.700
find a reversal of pregnancy. I mean,

26:59.700 --> 27:01.680
after 20 years of being kicked around in

27:01.680 --> 27:03.160
the states of Mississippi and Alabama, in

27:03.160 --> 27:04.400
the northern ghettos, because you're

27:04.400 --> 27:09.480
black, you can't help but dislike white. I

27:09.480 --> 27:10.600
mean, these people are not, you know,

27:12.960 --> 27:15.160
They're not Jesus or anybody else because

27:15.160 --> 27:18.160
they don't love all men. And they have

27:18.160 --> 27:22.660
real hate towards the white race. And

27:22.660 --> 27:24.020
they're fighting with these. I mean, it's

27:24.020 --> 27:27.560
a struggle. And you're not going to like

27:27.560 --> 27:28.860
it. Maybe you're not supposed to like it.

27:29.660 --> 27:30.960
But you're going to have to realize it's

27:30.960 --> 27:33.400
there. It's in the framework of what's

27:33.400 --> 27:36.680
there. There have been volunteers who've

27:36.680 --> 27:38.940
come back, you know, really down on his

27:38.940 --> 27:42.440
neck. especially white females because

27:42.440 --> 27:44.340
they just don't have power. I mean the

27:44.340 --> 27:46.820
priority in terms of people wanted to go

27:46.820 --> 27:50.440
south was black southerners, white

27:50.440 --> 27:53.920
southerners, black northerners, white

27:53.920 --> 27:56.740
northerners. You break that northerners

27:56.740 --> 27:59.920
down, white male northerners and last but

27:59.920 --> 28:03.600
not least was white female law that was

28:03.600 --> 28:08.380
just it that works that way in terms of

28:08.380 --> 28:10.500
how much you can get how much influence

28:10.500 --> 28:15.560
you have you're a black male you carry

28:15.560 --> 28:16.880
yourself like you know what you're doing

28:16.880 --> 28:19.920
and you do your job to move people to move

28:19.920 --> 28:23.800
people and staff outside of staff your

28:23.800 --> 28:27.440
wife email and you don't work go to build

28:27.440 --> 28:30.400
a black man comes along, you have no

28:30.400 --> 28:33.160
influence, you have no power. People are

28:33.160 --> 28:34.280
constantly working to get you out of the

28:34.280 --> 28:35.640
state. I think you should be put out of

28:35.640 --> 28:38.940
the state. And this is another unfortunate

28:38.940 --> 28:43.820
thing. Last summer, too many, and one was

28:43.820 --> 28:46.100
too many, white females came into the

28:46.100 --> 28:49.360
state simply to sleep with white, black

28:49.360 --> 28:52.800
males. And this was something that

28:52.800 --> 28:54.000
couldn't be found out, you know, from

28:54.000 --> 28:55.580
psychological testing, of course.

28:59.460 --> 29:03.260
And you know, at least I hope you can

29:03.260 --> 29:05.140
begin to understand the reaction of black

29:05.140 --> 29:09.240
females as sick. I mean, the black males

29:09.240 --> 29:10.740
were castrated all through this country.

29:11.340 --> 29:13.180
Black females had to put up with, you

29:13.180 --> 29:16.520
know, shit from one end to the other. And

29:16.520 --> 29:19.280
suddenly here are men beginning to emerge

29:19.280 --> 29:20.880
as truly men in this country who are

29:20.880 --> 29:22.860
black, and white females come along and

29:22.860 --> 29:27.240
take them away. And that's the one topic

29:27.240 --> 29:29.040
of conversation that everybody talks about

29:29.040 --> 29:31.740
here. Everybody. That whole sex hang-up.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.880
And maybe that's the largest hang-up in

29:33.880 --> 29:36.160
this country. And when you put it in terms

29:36.160 --> 29:41.500
of race, it just becomes a very sick

29:41.500 --> 29:41.740
thing.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.400
The world's not going to change overnight,

29:47.660 --> 29:50.600
but when I talk to volunteers who are

29:50.600 --> 29:52.500
going south, usually on a very personal

29:52.500 --> 29:55.740
level, one to two or two to one, I put it

29:55.740 --> 29:56.940
very bluntly, especially the white

29:56.940 --> 29:59.120
females. The only way you're going to make

29:59.120 --> 30:00.680
it inside the civil rights movement of the

30:00.680 --> 30:04.280
south is work. I mean, that's the only

30:04.280 --> 30:06.740
thing that proves you. I mean, the people,

30:07.020 --> 30:10.340
you know, we don't care what you think or

30:10.340 --> 30:13.500
why you're going. that's your business as

30:13.500 --> 30:14.500
long as you do the job

30:18.000 --> 30:19.560
the other thing is going to prove his work

30:23.460 --> 30:24.860
I just sleep with what you want to sleep

30:24.860 --> 30:26.940
with but you're gonna run into a lot of

30:26.940 --> 30:30.520
lines and a lot of beautiful people it's

30:30.520 --> 30:33.560
very twisted by the society and you're

30:33.560 --> 30:35.300
simply gonna have to watch yourself if you

30:35.300 --> 30:36.060
expect to survive

30:38.980 --> 30:41.760
That's a very grim picture. But it's this

30:41.760 --> 30:43.820
country, and with this country and this

30:43.820 --> 30:44.820
society, it's done to people.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.180
In terms of data, as I said before, I

30:55.180 --> 30:57.540
don't think it's half as bad as it was in

30:57.540 --> 31:01.340
the last summer. And it's unfortunate that

31:01.340 --> 31:03.900
those 750 white volunteers from the North

31:03.900 --> 31:05.660
was the only thing that could break that

31:05.660 --> 31:08.300
state. The black people have been dying

31:08.300 --> 31:11.900
there for 40 years. Suddenly two white

31:11.900 --> 31:14.700
northerners die, and this whole country is

31:14.700 --> 31:19.560
up in arms. But they did make it possible

31:19.560 --> 31:21.380
for people to go into counties and work

31:21.380 --> 31:22.680
where nobody could work before for

31:22.680 --> 31:25.260
registration. Counties where there were 4

31:25.260 --> 31:27.920
,000 whites and 12,000 Negroes, and

31:27.920 --> 31:29.020
nobody's been registered since

31:29.020 --> 31:29.680
Reconstruction.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.740
They walked in, the Senators started

31:34.740 --> 31:36.980
calling, the Senators started calling on

31:36.980 --> 31:39.000
phones, the Governor started calling, the

31:39.000 --> 31:40.620
FBI walked in, the Justice Department

31:40.620 --> 31:43.120
walked in, and the Sheriff said, Goddamn.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.900
And it worked. And a lot of those people

31:49.900 --> 31:53.540
did, you know, really good jobs. And

31:53.540 --> 31:55.120
there's a job for you to, you know, do in

31:55.120 --> 31:58.180
the state of Mississippi. Everybody can't

31:58.180 --> 31:59.640
work on voter registration full time.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.880
People have got to eat. And each county

32:02.880 --> 32:05.100
just about laid out its program and asked

32:05.100 --> 32:06.160
for the number of volunteers that it

32:06.160 --> 32:08.660
wants. There's going to be a difference

32:08.660 --> 32:10.780
this summer in terms of who you work for.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.760
Last summer people basically worked under

32:13.760 --> 32:16.260
the guidance of SNCC. It's a nice little

32:16.260 --> 32:19.640
establishment, to say the least. But this

32:19.640 --> 32:22.780
summer you're working for the FTP, which

32:22.780 --> 32:25.540
is better in one way, because you don't go

32:25.540 --> 32:28.200
into a county trying to make contacts or

32:28.200 --> 32:30.920
trying to get into the community you have

32:30.920 --> 32:32.240
somebody in the community asking for you

32:32.240 --> 32:36.700
and waiting for you you got it made on the

32:36.700 --> 32:39.280
other hand they're a hell of a lot more

32:39.280 --> 32:42.740
conservative in terms of dress,

32:43.060 --> 32:48.720
sexualized, religion and please don't go

32:48.720 --> 32:51.120
around trying to convince the good sisters

32:51.120 --> 32:52.140
they should be a

32:56.580 --> 32:59.800
religious have a personal thing anyway for

32:59.800 --> 33:02.240
too many years that's the only thing that

33:02.240 --> 33:05.480
they've had keep them going when you

33:05.480 --> 33:07.100
attack that you would take attack the

33:07.100 --> 33:10.100
basic finally those are the big you're

33:10.100 --> 33:14.100
gonna lose just leave that top They're

33:14.100 --> 33:15.580
going to draw you out, you know, make your

33:15.580 --> 33:16.440
own decisions on the spot.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.600
But they have their programs laid out,

33:23.640 --> 33:25.420
community centers, freedom schools, voter

33:25.420 --> 33:28.200
registration, specialized projects. And in

33:28.200 --> 33:29.640
some instances, they're asking people with

33:29.640 --> 33:33.980
specialized skills. And go in. They know

33:33.980 --> 33:36.580
what they want done. They want your help.
