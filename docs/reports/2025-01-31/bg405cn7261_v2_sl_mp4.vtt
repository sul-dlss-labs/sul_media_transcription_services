WEBVTT

00:24.420 --> 00:27.020
Okay, good. Thank you so much, Mark. My

00:27.020 --> 00:29.580
name is Amanda Whitmire. I am from the

00:29.580 --> 00:31.740
Miller Marine Biology Library here at

00:31.740 --> 00:33.220
Stanford Libraries, and I'm going to spend

00:33.220 --> 00:35.920
the next 10 minutes talking about student

00:35.920 --> 00:37.740
work and FERPA. And I nixed copyright

00:37.740 --> 00:39.120
because I only have 10 minutes, and

00:39.120 --> 00:40.680
there's a copyright person coming up in a

00:40.680 --> 00:42.360
bit later, so we won't worry about that

00:42.360 --> 00:46.440
for now. So FERPA is U.S. law, but I'm

00:46.440 --> 00:48.900
discussing it through the lens of a

00:48.900 --> 00:51.520
librarian at a marine research station

00:52.020 --> 00:54.400
with the intent of really just putting it

00:54.400 --> 00:56.280
on our collective radar as we move forward

00:56.280 --> 00:58.220
talking about archives and access over the

00:58.220 --> 01:01.160
next couple days. And just for context, my

01:01.160 --> 01:03.460
library is actually located at the Hopkins

01:03.460 --> 01:05.440
Marine Station, which is about 90 miles

01:05.440 --> 01:08.220
south of here, perched on the southern tip

01:08.220 --> 01:13.560
of Monterey Bay. Lucky me. So let's just

01:13.560 --> 01:16.700
get right into it. What is FERPA? So FERPA

01:16.700 --> 01:18.560
is a federal law that came in response

01:18.560 --> 01:20.480
really to a history of inconsistent

01:20.480 --> 01:23.380
institutional policies and improper

01:23.380 --> 01:25.680
disclosure of student information. So the

01:25.680 --> 01:27.720
intent of FERPA really is to protect

01:27.720 --> 01:30.440
privacy of both parents and student

01:30.440 --> 01:31.020
information.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.960
And what FERPA says is that institutions

01:35.960 --> 01:38.320
that receive federal funds have to provide

01:38.320 --> 01:40.160
parents with access to the educational

01:40.160 --> 01:42.260
records of their children, although this

01:42.260 --> 01:43.820
right transfers to the student once they

01:43.820 --> 01:47.300
turn 18. It prohibits releasing the

01:47.300 --> 01:50.160
educational records of students other than

01:50.160 --> 01:52.580
directory information without written

01:52.580 --> 01:56.340
consent, although consent is not required

01:56.340 --> 01:58.600
for release of the education records to

01:58.600 --> 02:00.720
certain institutions and organizations,

02:01.160 --> 02:06.360
which is slightly confusing, right? So

02:06.360 --> 02:07.980
recall that I mentioned that directory

02:07.980 --> 02:09.420
information can be released without

02:09.420 --> 02:11.120
consent. So what is directory information?

02:11.120 --> 02:12.920
It's things that wouldn't be considered a

02:12.920 --> 02:15.480
violation of the student's privacy, which

02:15.480 --> 02:18.100
surprisingly includes things like place

02:18.100 --> 02:20.440
and date of birth, their photograph. If

02:20.440 --> 02:21.780
they're on an athletic team, you can

02:21.780 --> 02:24.260
release their height and weight. So I'll

02:24.260 --> 02:26.120
leave it to you to decide how invasive you

02:26.120 --> 02:29.540
think this non-private information really

02:29.540 --> 02:32.780
is. And then recall also that consent

02:32.780 --> 02:34.960
wasn't required to release certain

02:34.960 --> 02:38.400
education records of students. Well, what

02:38.400 --> 02:41.160
are those? FERPA defines those as being

02:41.160 --> 02:44.820
student works that are directly related to

02:44.820 --> 02:47.680
the students process through school and

02:47.680 --> 02:48.780
they're maintained by the educational

02:48.780 --> 02:50.900
institution and it could be handwritten

02:50.900 --> 02:53.940
assignments, digital media, and so on.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.480
Lots of different formats. So already this

02:57.480 --> 02:59.480
is pretty confusing and as librarians and

02:59.480 --> 03:00.900
archivists you're probably wondering well

03:00.900 --> 03:03.440
what is the overlap between student work

03:03.440 --> 03:05.620
you might have in your collection and

03:05.620 --> 03:07.420
FERPA? What is considered an education

03:07.420 --> 03:09.940
record and might have to be collected and

03:09.940 --> 03:11.140
what is something that we can make

03:11.140 --> 03:14.400
available. And so ALA actually asked the

03:14.400 --> 03:16.000
US Department of Education this question

03:16.000 --> 03:18.640
in 1993 and the Department of Ed clarified

03:18.640 --> 03:21.800
saying something like a thesis which a

03:21.800 --> 03:24.440
student gives to the library generally for

03:24.440 --> 03:26.260
the known purpose of being made available

03:26.260 --> 03:29.900
as a research material. The process of the

03:29.900 --> 03:31.620
student giving their material to the

03:31.620 --> 03:33.380
library provides a form of tacit

03:33.380 --> 03:35.020
permission to to make those materials

03:35.020 --> 03:36.340
available as research objects.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.460
So as we've seen, the regulations

03:42.460 --> 03:44.460
concerning student work or educational

03:44.460 --> 03:48.880
records can be confusing, but FERPA is

03:48.880 --> 03:50.520
important, and our understanding of FERPA

03:50.520 --> 03:52.020
is important because I think students

03:52.020 --> 03:54.560
produce really important research that's

03:54.560 --> 03:55.840
critical to our understanding of the

03:55.840 --> 03:58.060
world. And to the extent possible, I wanna

03:58.060 --> 03:59.940
be able to make those research materials

03:59.940 --> 04:03.140
available. And so for the next few

04:03.140 --> 04:04.260
minutes, I'm going to give you an example

04:04.260 --> 04:05.500
of something that I've been navigating

04:05.500 --> 04:07.860
through my work recently to give you some

04:07.860 --> 04:10.320
context on my thoughts on this issue. And

04:10.320 --> 04:11.960
it's going to seem like a little bit of a

04:11.960 --> 04:13.700
tangent at first, but stick with me. It's

04:13.700 --> 04:16.940
all going to come back together. So has

04:16.940 --> 04:19.260
anyone in this room ever used the Merlin

04:19.260 --> 04:21.700
Bird ID app or iNaturalist to identify

04:21.700 --> 04:25.340
something? Yes. My people. You're my

04:25.340 --> 04:27.640
people. Perfect. So when you take a

04:27.640 --> 04:29.120
picture of something and you upload it

04:29.120 --> 04:30.920
into Merlin or to iNaturalist, what you're

04:30.920 --> 04:32.500
doing is you're collecting three pieces of

04:32.500 --> 04:35.520
information. I saw this thing in this

04:35.520 --> 04:38.100
place at this time. And those three pieces

04:38.100 --> 04:39.640
of information together are called a

04:39.640 --> 04:40.220
species occurrence.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.180
And there's a place called GBIF, the

04:46.180 --> 04:47.880
Global Biodiversity Information Facility,

04:47.880 --> 04:49.800
that gathers species occurrence records

04:49.800 --> 04:52.400
from iNaturalist, from eBird, from

04:52.400 --> 04:54.340
academic research that's happening all

04:54.340 --> 04:56.080
over the world. And as it stands, they

04:56.080 --> 05:00.300
have almost 1.4 billion records of, I saw

05:00.300 --> 05:03.420
this thing in this place at this time. And

05:03.420 --> 05:05.140
why is that important? Well, if you're

05:05.140 --> 05:06.760
interested in understanding things like

05:06.760 --> 05:08.620
how climate change might be shifting the

05:08.620 --> 05:10.220
distribution of animals and plants on the

05:10.220 --> 05:12.240
planet, you have to understand not only

05:12.240 --> 05:14.140
where they are now, but where they were

05:14.140 --> 05:16.840
before. And that is the power of 1.4

05:16.840 --> 05:21.440
billion observations in GBIF. So as one

05:21.440 --> 05:22.860
example, say you're interested in knowing

05:22.860 --> 05:25.700
where this very common marine anemone can

05:25.700 --> 05:28.040
be found in the world, Anthoplaura, and

05:28.040 --> 05:29.840
you go to GBIF and you take a look and see

05:29.840 --> 05:31.400
what they have, you'll see that there's

05:31.400 --> 05:33.660
almost 2,500 species occurrence records,

05:33.820 --> 05:37.300
which sounds like a lot of data. But if

05:37.300 --> 05:39.620
you take one step deeper into the data,

05:39.700 --> 05:41.300
what you find is that the large majority

05:41.300 --> 05:43.520
of our records of this organism, and in

05:43.520 --> 05:45.780
fact the majority of all of the records in

05:45.780 --> 05:48.040
GBIF, are very recent. And if you're

05:48.040 --> 05:49.700
interested in looking at things on the

05:49.700 --> 05:51.240
scale of climate change, you need to be

05:51.240 --> 05:53.800
able to look much further back in time. So

05:53.800 --> 05:56.460
how do we fill this observational gap? And

05:56.460 --> 05:57.660
that's where I think long-standing

05:57.660 --> 05:59.680
educational institutions like Stanford and

05:59.680 --> 06:01.520
others really are poised to make a

06:01.520 --> 06:04.020
significant contribution. And one area

06:04.020 --> 06:06.280
where I think we can make a contribution

06:06.280 --> 06:08.000
locally is through the undergraduate work

06:08.000 --> 06:09.720
of our students. So in particular I just

06:09.720 --> 06:11.540
want to give this one example of two

06:11.540 --> 06:13.220
students, Sarah Gilman and Rafe Stagrin.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.740
They came to Hopkins in the summer of 1993

06:15.740 --> 06:18.820
and what they chose to do for their

06:18.820 --> 06:20.740
research project was to resample a

06:20.740 --> 06:23.420
transect that was first sampled in 1931 to

06:23.420 --> 06:26.340
1933. So there's an an intertidal line

06:26.340 --> 06:28.660
that goes from the shore out 105 yards.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.760
They finally found the line after three

06:30.760 --> 06:33.360
days, started by that brass bolt. They

06:33.360 --> 06:35.500
looked at 19 square yards along this line.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
They counted up all the species and they

06:37.600 --> 06:39.560
compared what they saw to what another

06:39.560 --> 06:41.740
researcher had seen back in the 1930s. And

06:41.740 --> 06:43.220
what they discovered was that there was a

06:43.220 --> 06:45.500
shift toward warmer water species. And

06:45.500 --> 06:47.100
along with a temperature time series that

06:47.100 --> 06:48.340
we also maintain at Hopkins, they

06:48.340 --> 06:50.420
hypothesized that this might be due to

06:50.420 --> 06:52.980
shifting ocean temperatures. And their

06:52.980 --> 06:57.500
student paper is in my library. So based

06:57.500 --> 06:58.980
on that work, they came back the following

06:58.980 --> 07:00.620
summer. They did more work. They

07:00.620 --> 07:03.660
identified over 58,000 individuals from

07:03.660 --> 07:06.620
105 different invertebrate taxa. And

07:06.620 --> 07:08.200
again, they were able to, with this

07:08.200 --> 07:12.400
greater body of data, actually show a

07:12.400 --> 07:14.340
strong correlation between species shifts

07:14.340 --> 07:16.360
and changing ocean temperatures. And their

07:16.360 --> 07:18.220
work as undergraduates was published in

07:18.220 --> 07:23.020
Science. Not bad. But their work is just

07:23.020 --> 07:25.280
one paper in a much larger collection that

07:25.280 --> 07:27.060
we have in our library that expands from

07:27.060 --> 07:30.100
every year a class was the same class was

07:30.100 --> 07:33.240
taught from 1963 to 2011 and these are all

07:33.240 --> 07:34.800
of their unbound papers which are now

07:34.800 --> 07:36.780
actually here on campus being digitized.

07:38.580 --> 07:41.020
But what you'll also find out is that my

07:41.020 --> 07:42.340
collection of student papers is not

07:42.340 --> 07:44.000
unique. So these are similar collections

07:44.000 --> 07:45.440
in Washington up at Friday Harbor,

07:45.700 --> 07:48.260
collection starts in the 40s, up at Bodega

07:48.260 --> 07:49.820
Marine Labs just north of us here, their

07:49.820 --> 07:51.900
collection starts in the 1920s and is on

07:51.900 --> 07:53.940
both of these are ongoing. Here's a

07:53.940 --> 07:55.460
collection from Banfield Marine Science

07:55.460 --> 07:59.320
Center up in Canada, British Columbia. And

07:59.320 --> 08:00.800
when I reached out to my colleagues at

08:00.800 --> 08:02.280
other marine stations, what I found is

08:02.280 --> 08:04.060
there are literally thousands of

08:04.060 --> 08:05.700
undergraduate student research papers

08:05.700 --> 08:08.760
available for local use in our libraries.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.900
So if you're interested in exploring

08:10.900 --> 08:12.560
something like climate change for an

08:12.560 --> 08:15.000
intertidal species, this body of work is

08:15.000 --> 08:18.060
unprecedented in its coverage in space and

08:18.060 --> 08:21.180
time. But what does this have to do with

08:21.180 --> 08:24.640
FERPA? You're all wondering, Amanda. And

08:24.640 --> 08:26.740
so what I discovered when I was working

08:26.740 --> 08:28.180
with my colleagues up and down the coast

08:28.180 --> 08:30.140
to assess the potential for creating just

08:30.140 --> 08:32.740
a federated catalog, let's get all the

08:32.740 --> 08:34.040
bibliographies of all these students

08:34.040 --> 08:35.860
papers together, put them in one place, so

08:35.860 --> 08:37.680
if a researcher wanted to know just what's

08:37.680 --> 08:39.040
out there in terms of student research,

08:39.240 --> 08:41.600
can I find it? What I discovered is that

08:41.600 --> 08:43.560
in at least two cases of those libraries

08:43.560 --> 08:46.520
on the last slide, the librarians were

08:46.520 --> 08:47.840
limited in their ability to share

08:47.840 --> 08:49.360
bibliographies because of the

08:49.360 --> 08:52.340
institution's understanding of FERPA. So

08:52.340 --> 08:53.820
in the case in front of you here, the

08:53.820 --> 08:55.700
librarian was told she had to remove all

08:55.700 --> 08:57.220
of the student names, the student author

08:57.220 --> 08:58.420
names from the papers from the

08:58.420 --> 09:00.160
bibliography. This is our oldest

09:00.160 --> 09:02.900
collection, it goes back to 1928, so she

09:02.900 --> 09:05.140
had to remove all those names by hand. She

09:05.140 --> 09:06.980
was also told she couldn't put these in

09:06.980 --> 09:09.620
the library catalog, so what she did is

09:09.620 --> 09:12.260
she created a PDF and she shares this on

09:12.260 --> 09:13.960
the library webpage. And if you'd like to

09:13.960 --> 09:16.360
search it, you can use a control F to

09:16.360 --> 09:18.860
search her catalog of student papers. In

09:18.860 --> 09:20.740
another case, a librarian was told point

09:20.740 --> 09:22.460
blank, you can't put this bibliography

09:22.460 --> 09:24.080
online, period. It's an invasion of

09:24.080 --> 09:27.000
students' privacy. But you remember what

09:27.000 --> 09:28.460
what the US Department of Education said.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.240
When a student gives the work to the

09:30.240 --> 09:32.640
library, it's tasked with permission to

09:32.640 --> 09:34.480
share the work. I'm not talking about

09:34.480 --> 09:35.820
copyright, that's a totally separate

09:35.820 --> 09:38.060
issue, but it's perfectly acceptable to

09:38.060 --> 09:39.460
make the work available through the

09:39.460 --> 09:42.400
library. And their name is directory

09:42.400 --> 09:44.380
information, that's not protected. So

09:44.380 --> 09:45.780
there seems to be a lot of confusion about

09:45.780 --> 09:48.200
FERPA that's really limiting our ability

09:48.200 --> 09:50.680
as librarians to distribute content and

09:50.680 --> 09:52.800
make it discoverable in ways that we think

09:52.800 --> 09:57.020
are unacceptable. acceptable. So I hope

09:57.020 --> 09:59.440
I've been able to show you that there's

09:59.440 --> 10:01.300
potential that lies within student work

10:01.300 --> 10:04.000
and the impact that you can have so that

10:04.000 --> 10:05.940
you might understand my frustration and my

10:05.940 --> 10:09.300
interest in FERPA. As a librarian, I feel

10:09.300 --> 10:10.980
a moral obligation to make critical

10:10.980 --> 10:12.480
observational research data and

10:12.480 --> 10:15.100
information available to researchers to

10:15.100 --> 10:17.940
the widest extent possible under the

10:17.940 --> 10:19.940
growing threat of climate change, siloed

10:19.940 --> 10:22.680
catalogs or worse yet catalogs that you

10:22.680 --> 10:24.500
can't even find are completely

10:24.500 --> 10:27.700
unacceptable as a status quo and I know I

10:27.700 --> 10:30.280
don't need to tell you guys that. So we

10:30.280 --> 10:32.060
need new ways to discover and access the

10:32.060 --> 10:33.880
research hiding in our collections and in

10:33.880 --> 10:36.060
the case of student works this means that

10:36.060 --> 10:38.100
we have to understand the limits and the

10:38.100 --> 10:41.040
latitudes associated with FERPA and that's

10:41.040 --> 10:42.220
why I wanted to share it with you today.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.000
Thank you.

10:48.160 --> 10:48.780
Thank you.
