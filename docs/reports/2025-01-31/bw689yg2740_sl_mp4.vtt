WEBVTT

00:01.980 --> 00:04.220
The person who's going to say the blessing

00:04.220 --> 00:07.820
is Benny Shendo, who is the director of

00:07.820 --> 00:09.900
our American Indian program here at

00:09.900 --> 00:12.780
Stanford, and he's Hamas.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.480
I'm going to say the opening prayer in my

00:18.480 --> 00:22.020
own language. So also, as I say the

00:22.020 --> 00:23.520
prayer, you can say your own prayer as

00:23.520 --> 00:23.680
well.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.480
I feel that the people who are here today,

00:58.460 --> 01:01.240
they cannot go to the other side of the

01:01.240 --> 01:03.700
world, and they cannot go to the other

01:03.700 --> 01:06.600
side of the world, and they cannot go to

01:06.600 --> 01:07.900
the other side of the world, and they

01:07.900 --> 01:09.120
cannot go to the other side of the world,

01:09.120 --> 01:13.760
and they cannot go to the other side of

01:13.760 --> 01:18.120
the world, and they cannot

01:18.120 --> 01:24.020
go to the other side of the world, .

01:41.560 --> 01:44.400
OK. I guess we're going to go ahead and

01:44.400 --> 01:46.540
get started. So everyone can be seated.

01:46.540 --> 01:52.780
AND FIND

01:52.780 --> 01:53.220
A SEAT.

02:20.820 --> 02:25.100
Okay, just to, we want to welcome you to

02:25.100 --> 02:27.060
Stanford University, everyone who's come

02:27.060 --> 02:30.000
from other universities. My name is Rania

02:30.000 --> 02:34.400
Ramirez. I'm a part of SNAG, which is

02:34.400 --> 02:37.320
Stanford Native American Graduate Group,

02:37.320 --> 02:42.240
and we helped put put this conference

02:42.240 --> 02:47.020
together or this forum together. We just

02:47.020 --> 02:49.640
want to say that this is supposed to be

02:49.640 --> 02:52.820
like a conversation. The way it's going to

02:52.820 --> 02:56.960
work is each person who is going to talk

02:56.960 --> 02:59.240
about their work is going to come and sit

02:59.240 --> 03:01.620
at this point in the table, mainly because

03:01.620 --> 03:03.980
we are videotaping the event.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.260
And we'll present for about 10 minutes.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.860
and then the rest of the time will be for

03:13.860 --> 03:17.200
basically a conversation just to talk

03:17.200 --> 03:19.600
about you know the issues that were

03:19.600 --> 03:24.260
brought up in the presentation maybe some

03:24.260 --> 03:27.120
similar experiences we've had doing doing

03:27.120 --> 03:31.400
research just you know very informal you

03:31.400 --> 03:33.320
know we want people to feel comfortable

03:33.320 --> 03:38.760
and just just really enjoy the day. We're

03:38.760 --> 03:42.680
going to start out with Benny Shendo who's

03:42.680 --> 03:44.880
going to come up and say a few words and

03:44.880 --> 03:48.040
then after Benny Shendo will be Jim

03:48.040 --> 03:51.880
Larimore who used to be the director of

03:51.880 --> 03:53.980
our American Indian program office but is

03:53.980 --> 03:57.220
now the acting dean of students here at

03:57.220 --> 03:57.560
the university.

04:04.140 --> 04:08.620
Again, I'd just like to welcome all of you

04:08.620 --> 04:14.540
to the second annual research forum. As

04:14.540 --> 04:16.620
Rania mentioned, I'm the Assistant Dean of

04:16.620 --> 04:18.260
Students and also Director of our American

04:18.260 --> 04:21.980
Indian program. I'm new to Stanford. I've

04:21.980 --> 04:25.600
been here for going on my seventh month,

04:25.720 --> 04:29.360
but it's been really good. When Gil

04:29.360 --> 04:32.660
mentioned this forum last year, they had

04:32.660 --> 04:35.620
their first annual, it really got me

04:35.620 --> 04:37.040
excited because it was one of the things

04:37.040 --> 04:39.280
that we really wanted to do is, you know,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.640
what are some of our students doing in

04:41.640 --> 04:44.020
terms of scholarship and work that affect

04:44.020 --> 04:47.120
Native communities. So we talked about it

04:47.120 --> 04:49.360
and we began to brainstorm it. We did it

04:49.360 --> 04:51.280
last year, it was very informal, and it

04:51.280 --> 04:53.180
was a wonderful experience. We wanted to

04:53.180 --> 04:54.780
keep it that way. We wanted it to be a

04:54.780 --> 04:59.460
conversation, a discussion, so that we

04:59.460 --> 05:03.560
could really get a lot out of it. So we

05:03.560 --> 05:07.320
planned it, and Renia has been very, both

05:07.320 --> 05:08.900
Renia and Gail have been very instrumental

05:09.260 --> 05:13.040
in making this happen again. So I'd just

05:13.040 --> 05:15.040
like to welcome all of you on behalf of

05:15.040 --> 05:16.600
our American Indian and Alaska Native

05:16.600 --> 05:19.000
program at Stanford. So I hope you enjoy

05:19.000 --> 05:21.160
your day. Jim?

05:26.440 --> 05:29.380
I guess this is kind of an unusual thing

05:29.380 --> 05:30.660
for me because, as Renia mentioned, I've

05:30.660 --> 05:34.460
been kind of changing my professional

05:34.460 --> 05:36.800
identities around Stanford for the last

05:36.800 --> 05:40.100
year or so and have made a series of

05:40.100 --> 05:42.520
shifts. And the shifts that have come have

05:42.520 --> 05:45.000
been after serving for nine years as the

05:45.000 --> 05:46.360
director for the American Indian program,

05:46.960 --> 05:50.040
making a break and starting full-time as a

05:50.040 --> 05:51.260
doctoral student over in the School of

05:51.260 --> 05:53.440
Education in higher ed and administration

05:53.440 --> 05:56.260
and policy analysis last fall. And after

05:56.260 --> 05:58.920
six months of being a student, taking a

05:58.920 --> 06:00.840
leave and stepping in as the acting dean

06:00.840 --> 06:03.200
of students here, and after my first week

06:03.200 --> 06:04.900
on the job, which was just this past week,

06:05.000 --> 06:06.020
I can't tell you how much I'm looking

06:06.020 --> 06:07.340
forward to going back to being a student

06:07.340 --> 06:11.300
again in September and just getting much

06:11.300 --> 06:13.800
more in touch with classroom life, with

06:13.800 --> 06:17.440
research and with a chance to really focus

06:17.440 --> 06:20.420
on thinking hard about things, on kind of

06:20.420 --> 06:22.400
how things are, how they got that way, and

06:22.400 --> 06:25.380
maybe how they could be. And so this is,

06:25.400 --> 06:28.580
for me, a little bit of a homecoming in

06:28.580 --> 06:31.940
being back involved with the community

06:32.880 --> 06:35.680
after trying to maintain a little bit of

06:35.680 --> 06:37.960
distance to help my own transition this

06:37.960 --> 06:40.660
year. And so it's a real kind of honor and

06:40.660 --> 06:42.600
a pleasure to be among all the folks that

06:42.600 --> 06:45.500
are here this morning. I spoke yesterday

06:45.500 --> 06:47.760
afternoon with Condoleezza Rice, our

06:47.760 --> 06:50.300
university provost, and it was then that

06:50.300 --> 06:52.060
she informed me that she had a scheduling

06:52.060 --> 06:54.060
conflict that had come up with a gathering

06:54.060 --> 06:57.220
up in San Francisco. And so Condi asked me

06:57.220 --> 06:59.580
if I would extend a welcome on behalf of

06:59.580 --> 07:01.800
the university to folks that have traveled

07:01.800 --> 07:04.680
from other schools, other places here in

07:04.680 --> 07:07.040
California and elsewhere to be with us

07:07.040 --> 07:10.120
today. and and so I hope that it looks

07:10.120 --> 07:12.000
from looking out behind the camera and out

07:12.000 --> 07:14.260
the window that that this may be the kind

07:14.260 --> 07:15.920
of Stanford weather and Northern

07:15.920 --> 07:18.340
California weather that we're accustomed

07:18.340 --> 07:20.480
to here and so I hope that the

07:20.480 --> 07:22.560
surroundings will be pleasant and in

07:22.560 --> 07:24.500
supportive of the kind of thinking and

07:24.500 --> 07:26.420
talking that you all want to try and do

07:26.420 --> 07:30.600
today as as Benny was it was doing his

07:30.600 --> 07:33.520
opening prayer for this this gathering

07:33.520 --> 07:37.080
this morning it reminded me of how how

07:37.080 --> 07:39.900
important it is that as people gather that

07:39.900 --> 07:41.780
we pray, and as we pray that we pray for

07:41.780 --> 07:44.260
wisdom, among other things. And that the

07:44.260 --> 07:46.980
wisdom that we seek is in order to make

07:46.980 --> 07:49.520
life better for those around us, to make

07:49.520 --> 07:52.420
life better for those among us, and also

07:52.420 --> 07:54.100
to try and make life better for those yet

07:54.100 --> 07:57.400
to come. And I think that, for me,

07:57.440 --> 07:59.420
represents the spirit of what American

07:59.420 --> 08:01.580
Indian and Alaska Native research is

08:01.580 --> 08:05.020
about. We have been researchers and

08:05.020 --> 08:08.240
scholars for thousands of years and it may

08:08.240 --> 08:10.000
not have been things that have been

08:10.000 --> 08:11.680
written down and recorded in the forms

08:11.680 --> 08:14.340
that universities are used to. But I think

08:14.340 --> 08:16.420
you can find no better example of

08:16.420 --> 08:19.080
scholarship and humane scholarship than

08:19.080 --> 08:20.580
the kind of knowledge that exists within

08:20.580 --> 08:21.920
our communities, the kind of knowledge

08:21.920 --> 08:24.320
that people are about working with and

08:24.320 --> 08:28.200
creating and passing on. And so I want to

08:28.200 --> 08:32.800
say, again, on behalf of myself and for

08:32.800 --> 08:35.060
the university, that this is an important

08:35.060 --> 08:37.460
gathering and that this marks, I think, a

08:37.460 --> 08:39.820
real turning point for the way that we can

08:39.820 --> 08:41.420
support each other and the way that we can

08:41.420 --> 08:44.060
support students and support faculty,

08:44.280 --> 08:46.600
tenured and otherwise, in the pursuits and

08:46.600 --> 08:48.820
the kinds of pressures that they face in

08:48.820 --> 08:53.320
their lives. As people go through the day,

08:53.520 --> 08:58.220
what I would like to suggest or offer as a

08:58.220 --> 09:00.040
way of thinking about this is that people

09:00.040 --> 09:02.940
realize that this is a time, some of you

09:02.940 --> 09:04.220
may have met each other, you may have come

09:04.220 --> 09:05.800
with friends from other campuses, but this

09:05.800 --> 09:07.600
is a real opportunity to get to know

09:07.600 --> 09:09.740
people that you may come in contact with

09:09.740 --> 09:12.700
on an infrequent basis, people that you

09:12.700 --> 09:14.900
may not see until maybe during Powell

09:14.900 --> 09:16.360
season, and you'll see folks around

09:16.360 --> 09:18.540
different places, faces that you might

09:18.540 --> 09:20.140
recognize in different parts of the

09:20.140 --> 09:21.860
country at different meetings or community

09:21.860 --> 09:24.220
gatherings. And so I hope that during the

09:24.220 --> 09:26.220
day you'll take the opportunity to get to

09:26.220 --> 09:29.240
know some folks that may not be from where

09:29.240 --> 09:31.840
you're from and get a chance to help

09:31.840 --> 09:34.200
establish a tighter community base for all

09:34.200 --> 09:37.140
of us that way. I would also like to

09:37.140 --> 09:38.900
suggest that maybe there are a few

09:38.900 --> 09:41.200
different ways to think about how this

09:41.200 --> 09:43.340
gathering is situated and what this

09:43.340 --> 09:46.080
represents because I think it's important

09:46.080 --> 09:48.820
to be able to look at this assembly of

09:48.820 --> 09:50.540
people and to look back at how this

09:50.540 --> 09:52.660
connects with our past. And to think about

09:52.660 --> 09:54.160
how this connects you with previous

09:54.160 --> 09:56.900
generations within your own tribe, within

09:56.900 --> 09:58.720
your own communities, within the campus

09:58.720 --> 10:00.520
communities that you're a part of, within

10:00.520 --> 10:02.660
the whole idea of knowledge and what that

10:02.660 --> 10:05.260
represents for our communities. And so as

10:05.260 --> 10:08.840
you're here and as you're hopefully going

10:08.840 --> 10:10.040
through some of the excitement about

10:10.040 --> 10:12.120
thinking about things that people are

10:12.120 --> 10:13.360
going to present, you'll be able to feel

10:13.360 --> 10:14.680
some connection with those that have been

10:14.680 --> 10:17.120
here before you. I also hope that you'll

10:17.120 --> 10:18.920
feel a sense of that connection with the

10:18.920 --> 10:20.940
people that are here with you today, and

10:20.940 --> 10:22.960
that as you listen to people and engage in

10:22.960 --> 10:24.740
some discussions with each other, that

10:24.740 --> 10:27.520
you'll be able to do that in a friendly,

10:27.740 --> 10:30.280
cooperative, but even challenging way with

10:30.280 --> 10:31.960
each other, and to really help push each

10:31.960 --> 10:34.740
other to the best and the hardest thinking

10:34.740 --> 10:37.160
that you can do about things. And finally,

10:37.360 --> 10:40.340
which kind of brings me back to my old

10:40.340 --> 10:44.140
life, being, I think, more involved on a

10:44.140 --> 10:46.540
regular basis with the community here, I

10:46.540 --> 10:48.800
really hope that you'll carry some things

10:48.800 --> 10:50.720
away from this weekend that are going to

10:50.720 --> 10:52.640
help you within your own communities and

10:52.640 --> 10:53.940
especially that are going to help you

10:53.940 --> 10:55.740
reach out to one more person, one more

10:55.740 --> 10:58.660
student, whether they're a very young kid,

10:58.760 --> 11:01.160
whether they're in elementary school or

11:01.160 --> 11:03.020
junior high or high school, or maybe a

11:03.020 --> 11:04.340
college student on your own campus.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.360
Because the ultimate measure of how

11:06.360 --> 11:09.360
successful we are is going to be how much

11:09.360 --> 11:11.320
we're able to do to bring more people

11:11.320 --> 11:13.480
along with us. And so the knowledge, the

11:13.480 --> 11:15.780
kind of energy that you pick up today, I

11:15.780 --> 11:17.680
hope sustains you in your own activities,

11:17.880 --> 11:21.000
but I hope also helps you in your work as

11:21.000 --> 11:22.900
a community leader, as someone who has

11:22.900 --> 11:25.940
influence, as someone whose actions and

11:25.940 --> 11:28.400
thoughts and words carry a great deal of

11:28.400 --> 11:30.420
power. And so with that, I just want to

11:30.420 --> 11:32.600
say thanks to all of you for making the

11:32.600 --> 11:35.820
trip here early on a Saturday morning when

11:35.820 --> 11:38.060
I know that you've all been no doubt

11:38.060 --> 11:39.720
working hard on other things and we're

11:39.720 --> 11:41.480
getting up early this morning. It may not

11:41.480 --> 11:43.860
have been kind of what your original

11:43.860 --> 11:46.620
intention had been some time ago. We're

11:46.620 --> 11:50.020
just glad to have you here. And one final

11:50.020 --> 11:52.080
thing for, I guess I'll pass this along to

11:52.080 --> 11:54.620
Raina, is as the day goes on, you may find

11:54.620 --> 11:56.360
that you're in need of a break or

11:56.360 --> 11:58.900
something a little bit different. And so

11:58.900 --> 12:01.520
given that this is research, and I think

12:01.520 --> 12:03.740
sometimes people have fairly defined,

12:03.880 --> 12:06.440
rigid conceptions of research, I wanted to

12:06.440 --> 12:08.700
bring along a piece of poetry that was

12:08.700 --> 12:10.800
written by an Osage writer and poet named

12:10.800 --> 12:13.860
Dwayne Big Eagle, who has a poem entitled

12:13.860 --> 12:15.720
My Grandfather Was a Quantum Physicist

12:15.720 --> 12:18.420
that some of you may be familiar with. And

12:18.420 --> 12:20.160
so if there's a break and you need

12:20.160 --> 12:23.140
something a little kind of interesting and

12:23.140 --> 12:25.580
scholarly in a different way, I hope that

12:25.580 --> 12:26.920
this might be a benefit to you as well.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.360
Anyway, that's it. That's as long-winded

12:30.360 --> 12:31.680
as I can get speaking for me and the

12:31.680 --> 12:35.100
provost. Anyway, welcome. I'm glad that

12:35.100 --> 12:38.920
you're all here. Thanks, Jim.

12:42.580 --> 12:45.880
What we wanted to do also is if the

12:45.880 --> 12:48.380
professors who brought students, if they

12:48.380 --> 12:50.460
could introduce their students, you know,

12:50.480 --> 12:52.660
their name and their field and all that

12:52.660 --> 12:56.400
kind of thing. So we're going to go ahead

12:56.400 --> 12:58.020
and get started.

13:00.740 --> 13:04.940
So I'm going to let the professor from

13:04.940 --> 13:08.360
James here do the introductions.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.660
I just want to move up here a little.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.260
Let me just stand up for a minute so I can

13:18.260 --> 13:19.240
see everybody.

13:22.600 --> 13:26.220
I'm very glad to be here again. This year,

13:26.280 --> 13:28.620
I'm kind of reflecting, as we begin this

13:28.620 --> 13:30.920
day, on what we did last year. And it

13:30.920 --> 13:33.540
occurs to me that we've doubled in several

13:33.540 --> 13:36.180
ways. We've doubled in terms of the number

13:36.180 --> 13:37.660
of schools that are represented here. I

13:37.660 --> 13:39.260
think last year, it was just Stanford and

13:39.260 --> 13:41.560
UC Santa Cruz. and this year we've got

13:41.560 --> 13:43.540
people from Mills College and UC Berkeley

13:43.540 --> 13:46.100
is here too, is that right? So we're up to

13:46.100 --> 13:47.680
four schools in this area. That's

13:47.680 --> 13:50.220
exciting. We've doubled in the size of the

13:50.220 --> 13:53.500
room. That's always encouraging. We

13:53.500 --> 13:55.440
wouldn't have had enough room if we'd been

13:55.440 --> 13:58.460
back in that old space. And I've noticed,

13:58.540 --> 14:00.120
too, that we've doubled in the amount that

14:00.120 --> 14:01.920
Gil Ramirez is eating so far.

14:05.980 --> 14:09.180
I owed you one there.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.800
I had heard a lot of good things over the

14:15.800 --> 14:17.280
years about Jim Larimore, and it's been

14:17.280 --> 14:20.500
really nice to get a chance to meet him

14:20.500 --> 14:22.540
here this morning. And I feel like I've

14:22.540 --> 14:25.460
learned some things already. Although I'd

14:25.460 --> 14:26.920
heard what a wonderful person he was, I

14:26.920 --> 14:28.360
didn't realize how wise and knowledgeable

14:28.360 --> 14:29.720
he is because he said everything that I

14:29.720 --> 14:32.340
wanted to say. So I know he must be wise

14:32.340 --> 14:36.420
and knowledgeable. He said a lot of good

14:36.420 --> 14:38.920
things for us to keep in mind, and I don't

14:38.920 --> 14:42.900
have too much, nor should I really add to

14:42.900 --> 14:45.000
what he said. I do think this is an

14:45.000 --> 14:47.520
unusual event. I think that each one of us

14:47.520 --> 14:51.220
can think back in our own lives in

14:51.220 --> 14:53.440
whatever stage of the educational process

14:53.440 --> 14:56.160
that we may be in, and I mean the kind of

14:56.160 --> 14:58.980
restricted institutional formal kind of

14:58.980 --> 15:01.140
education that most of us in this room are

15:01.140 --> 15:02.800
involved in in one way or another. There's

15:02.800 --> 15:04.980
other kinds of education, other kinds of

15:04.980 --> 15:08.280
knowledge that maybe aren't as widely

15:08.280 --> 15:10.560
recognized as such by a lot of people as

15:10.560 --> 15:12.660
Jim has suggested. But certainly we can

15:12.660 --> 15:14.300
all think about our experiences in the

15:14.300 --> 15:17.080
educational institutions and realize that

15:17.080 --> 15:19.040
an event like this is a pretty unusual

15:19.040 --> 15:21.620
occurrence, or we can just come together

15:21.620 --> 15:25.640
in what has appropriately been called a

15:25.640 --> 15:27.400
research forum for American Indians,

15:27.400 --> 15:33.220
without having to defend the legitimacy of

15:33.220 --> 15:36.280
the kinds of concerns and questions and

15:36.280 --> 15:39.420
topics that we are concerned with before

15:39.420 --> 15:42.120
any kind of wider audience. So we can come

15:42.120 --> 15:44.740
together and talk to each other. That

15:44.740 --> 15:46.360
doesn't mean we all think alike. It

15:46.360 --> 15:47.500
doesn't mean that we all are going to

15:47.500 --> 15:49.380
approach any given issue in the same way.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.940
But that we can really come into this room

15:51.940 --> 15:55.900
and this space with a sense of community,

15:56.260 --> 15:59.900
of mutual understanding and respect and

15:59.900 --> 16:01.200
concern and have a meaningful

16:01.200 --> 16:03.960
conversation. We can say some things, talk

16:03.960 --> 16:09.480
about our own specific projects and also

16:09.480 --> 16:11.040
have a chance to learn from each other.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.980
Now I think one of the real ways in which

16:13.980 --> 16:16.880
the educational system fails us is when it

16:16.880 --> 16:18.800
creates a competitive environment that

16:18.800 --> 16:21.780
says that your worth is dependent on your

16:21.780 --> 16:24.560
GPA or the comments that the teacher

16:24.560 --> 16:27.880
writes on your paper or how you compare

16:27.880 --> 16:32.080
with other people. We know, I think, from

16:32.080 --> 16:34.080
a variety of different kinds of

16:34.080 --> 16:36.560
backgrounds that that kind of basis for

16:36.560 --> 16:40.580
human worth is not real solid. It actually

16:40.580 --> 16:43.200
contributes to a lot of the kinds of

16:43.200 --> 16:45.440
problems that we see in our society and in

16:45.440 --> 16:48.340
our own lives. So I would just kind of

16:48.340 --> 16:50.620
call that to our attention this morning,

16:50.680 --> 16:52.860
that we can kind of come to this with a

16:52.860 --> 16:54.280
different frame of mind, with a different

16:54.280 --> 16:56.920
understanding about what a human being is

16:56.920 --> 16:58.880
and what the importance of human

16:58.880 --> 17:00.820
creativity is. That doesn't mean that we

17:00.820 --> 17:02.900
can't challenge each other, that we can't

17:02.900 --> 17:05.660
push each other to think about issues in

17:05.660 --> 17:07.220
ways that we haven't looked at. I know I

17:07.220 --> 17:10.240
want to be challenged. I'm unfortunately

17:10.240 --> 17:11.820
not going to be here for the whole day.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.000
I'm going to Duluth, Minnesota, where I'm

17:15.000 --> 17:16.600
going to participate in the Tribal

17:16.600 --> 17:18.880
Colleges Consortium Annual Conference,

17:19.060 --> 17:20.540
something I've been looking forward to

17:20.540 --> 17:23.980
very well and for quite a long time and

17:23.980 --> 17:26.360
I'm going to be giving a kind of a

17:26.360 --> 17:28.840
workshop not really a I'm not going to

17:28.840 --> 17:30.580
make a presentation so much as a workshop

17:30.580 --> 17:32.160
on some things that I've been working on

17:32.160 --> 17:34.260
in Santa Cruz and mainly not because I

17:34.260 --> 17:35.760
think I have something to teach them but

17:35.760 --> 17:37.640
because I want to hear what they have to

17:37.640 --> 17:39.640
say to me from the tribal college context

17:39.640 --> 17:43.080
you know what we do at UC Santa Cruz so I

17:43.080 --> 17:45.180
think all of us can benefit from those

17:45.180 --> 17:48.800
kinds of feedback and and critique but

17:48.800 --> 17:50.700
that there's a way in which we can do that

17:50.700 --> 17:53.280
that builds builds us up as a community

17:53.280 --> 17:55.420
that builds us up as individuals rather

17:55.420 --> 17:58.000
than as in a sense of that well I have to

17:58.000 --> 18:00.500
show that I'm sharper than this person or

18:00.500 --> 18:01.920
I've thought about this a little more than

18:01.920 --> 18:03.680
they have or that there's any kind of a

18:03.680 --> 18:06.820
competitive competitive atmosphere you

18:06.820 --> 18:10.040
know we're all here for a reason this this

18:10.040 --> 18:12.660
forum has been facilitated and organized

18:12.660 --> 18:16.680
very very well by Iranian and and Gil

18:16.680 --> 18:18.980
Ramirez, and we owe them a lot of thanks.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.280
And I hope at the end of the day that

18:20.280 --> 18:21.960
you'll, or throughout the day that you'll

18:21.960 --> 18:24.240
have a chance to just express your

18:24.240 --> 18:26.700
appreciation for their work on this. But

18:26.700 --> 18:29.240
they've brought each of you here, you

18:29.240 --> 18:32.260
know, for a reason. And so there's nobody

18:32.260 --> 18:34.840
here that has to prove that they have a

18:34.840 --> 18:36.140
right to be here or that they have

18:36.140 --> 18:37.860
something to say. We're all kind of in

18:37.860 --> 18:41.020
this together, if you will. So I'm just

18:41.020 --> 18:44.200
gonna stop there there and maybe suggest a

18:44.200 --> 18:48.040
little bit about process. One of the ways

18:48.040 --> 18:50.280
we do have to sort of accommodate to the

18:50.280 --> 18:52.740
kinds of rules and regulations we've come

18:52.740 --> 18:54.420
to know on the institution has to do with

18:54.420 --> 18:57.400
the problem of time. And that is we've got

18:57.400 --> 18:58.880
a lot of people with a lot of good things

18:58.880 --> 19:02.040
to say here. And I know if we were maybe

19:02.040 --> 19:05.460
out at a community event or at an annual

19:05.460 --> 19:09.660
pow hour festival of some type, maybe we

19:09.660 --> 19:11.900
could put our watches away. way, but for

19:11.900 --> 19:13.780
the purposes of getting everyone a chance

19:13.780 --> 19:15.540
to speak, we are going to have to monitor

19:15.540 --> 19:17.780
the time just a little bit. So I'm going

19:17.780 --> 19:20.120
to, at least for the morning, I'll be

19:20.120 --> 19:21.820
gone. In the afternoon, you can handle it

19:21.820 --> 19:24.460
as you like, but for the morning, I think

19:24.460 --> 19:26.080
I'll just sit up here, and I'll probably

19:26.080 --> 19:27.780
prompt people when they get to about the

19:27.780 --> 19:30.460
10-minute mark with a slip of paper, and

19:30.460 --> 19:31.880
then give them about two more minutes just

19:31.880 --> 19:34.600
to wrap it up, and then we'll go from

19:34.600 --> 19:36.360
there into a time of question and answer,

19:36.460 --> 19:38.400
and really be thinking about, you know,

19:38.400 --> 19:40.480
engaging and listening listening actively,

19:40.840 --> 19:42.820
not just listening passively, but what's

19:42.820 --> 19:44.780
really being said and what's significant

19:44.780 --> 19:46.220
about what's going on here, and what might

19:46.220 --> 19:48.220
you be able to contribute. We'll also try

19:48.220 --> 19:50.920
to keep the questions to a fairly short

19:50.920 --> 19:53.620
format. If you want to make a speech, talk

19:53.620 --> 19:55.040
to Rani and she'll put you on the program.

19:55.340 --> 19:58.640
But if you just want to add another angle

19:58.640 --> 20:00.620
of thinking about something or ask a

20:00.620 --> 20:01.940
question, that would be the appropriate

20:01.940 --> 20:03.500
way, and we'll try to get as many people

20:03.500 --> 20:05.700
involved in that dialogue as possible. In

20:05.700 --> 20:06.940
fact, I was also going to suggest, if

20:06.940 --> 20:09.840
there's a couple people in the back tables

20:09.840 --> 20:12.360
who want to move up to these two seats in

20:12.360 --> 20:13.720
the front here, there's still a couple of

20:13.720 --> 20:15.740
open if you want to be part of this closer

20:15.740 --> 20:19.580
circle here. I just wanted to add that I

20:19.580 --> 20:22.100
asked Robert Warrior if he could help

20:22.100 --> 20:25.180
facilitate the question and answer. So if

20:25.180 --> 20:28.120
you want to say something, just kind of

20:28.120 --> 20:30.540
look at Robert and maybe just make a sign

20:30.540 --> 20:32.740
or something, and then he can kind of help

20:32.740 --> 20:34.780
with that. Do you want to move up here?

20:34.880 --> 20:35.020
Yeah.

20:42.340 --> 20:45.460
Anybody else that wants to just make a

20:45.460 --> 20:47.380
comment before we get going here, or a

20:47.380 --> 20:50.020
response of any type to the opening

20:50.020 --> 20:52.040
comments? The other thing I wanted to do,

20:52.100 --> 20:58.300
just before we began, is which I wanted to

20:58.300 --> 20:59.620
go around the room and make sure everyone

20:59.620 --> 21:02.100
just said their name, their tribe, and

21:02.100 --> 21:07.100
their school. So... Can we start back

21:07.100 --> 21:15.220
here? Clay, , , back to you. Jim still

21:15.220 --> 21:19.900

22:23.060 --> 22:26.160
teacher at UC Santa Cruz. So. So, your

22:26.160 --> 22:28.500
son, from Stanford.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.320
Rainier Maris, went to big on Chippewa

22:33.320 --> 22:37.080

22:51.020 --> 22:53.540
to go with the same name. I'm going to go

22:53.540 --> 22:54.340
with the same name. I'm going to go with

22:54.340 --> 22:54.340
the same name.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.960
I'm Larry Gross from Minnesota Chippewa.

23:05.660 --> 23:07.380
Right now I'm at Smith College in

23:07.380 --> 23:09.560
Northampton, Massachusetts. I've come a

23:09.560 --> 23:12.340
long way for this symposium. That's good.

23:12.340 --> 23:12.580
Pretty good.

23:16.960 --> 23:24.760
. . I'm Chris . Yeah, if at the end of the

23:24.760 --> 23:27.360
day you feel like it wasn't good, see Tina

23:27.360 --> 23:29.740
about getting your money back. She'll be

23:29.740 --> 23:31.520
glad to help you out. Not on the flight,

23:31.600 --> 23:33.180
just the registration. .

23:36.120 --> 23:38.040
Okay, well, let's begin then. Oh, I'm

23:38.040 --> 23:41.200
sorry. Yes, Gil. I just wanted to say, for

23:41.200 --> 23:43.040
those people that are not from here, kind

23:43.040 --> 23:44.560
of some important things, the bathrooms

23:44.560 --> 23:47.420
are downstairs. There's a men's bathroom

23:47.420 --> 23:49.980
right below here. And the women's bathroom

23:49.980 --> 23:56.120
is down the hall. Anyone else? Okay, we'll

23:56.120 --> 23:58.800
go ahead and get started then. It's my

23:58.800 --> 24:01.860
pleasure to introduce our first presenter

24:01.860 --> 24:04.500
from UC Santa Cruz, Terry Greaves' Kiowa.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.480
She's listed as history of consciousness,

24:06.800 --> 24:09.300
which is sort of wishful thinking on

24:09.300 --> 24:10.960
somebody's part, not mine. She's actually

24:10.960 --> 24:13.100
in American studies. I wish I could

24:13.100 --> 24:14.680
convince her to stick around and be a grad

24:14.680 --> 24:16.720
student at ISKCON so I could continue to

24:16.720 --> 24:18.300
work with her. But she's a graduating

24:18.300 --> 24:21.460
senior. And she's teaching a student

24:21.460 --> 24:23.500
-directed seminar this quarter, which is

24:23.500 --> 24:26.260
her last quarter, titled Indians,

24:26.500 --> 24:28.620
Redskins, Bucks, and Squaws, Images of

24:28.620 --> 24:30.980
Indians in American Popular Culture, which

24:30.980 --> 24:32.880
just started on Wednesday. She's only had

24:32.880 --> 24:35.400
one meeting. She's going to talk to us

24:35.400 --> 24:37.340
about her research, which she's been

24:37.340 --> 24:39.820
working on for a year or so, that went

24:39.820 --> 24:41.280
into the course, and then talk about her

24:41.280 --> 24:43.020
course design and some of the things, the

24:43.020 --> 24:45.420
kinds of methodological and theoretical

24:45.420 --> 24:48.000
issues that that raises. And I think it's

24:48.000 --> 24:51.260
a topic that we all can relate to at some

24:51.260 --> 24:53.720
level and hopefully will provoke some good

24:53.720 --> 24:57.580
discussion that may actually feed into her

24:57.580 --> 25:02.600
course too. So, Terri? Well, like you

25:02.600 --> 25:07.200
said, I'm teaching this class and, well, I

25:07.200 --> 25:08.620
guess I'm going to be a little more

25:08.620 --> 25:14.860
autobiographical than theoretical. But the

25:14.860 --> 25:18.260
reason why I started this, this class was

25:18.260 --> 25:20.660
going to be my thesis. And the reason why

25:20.660 --> 25:22.460
I started looking into images of Indians

25:22.460 --> 25:26.860
is because my mom owned an Indian arts and

25:26.860 --> 25:28.940
crafts store on Wind River Reservation in

25:28.940 --> 25:34.060
Wyoming. And my entire life, all the money

25:34.060 --> 25:37.420
that we've survived off of has come from

25:37.420 --> 25:41.300
selling Indian things and has come from

25:41.300 --> 25:46.560
consumers want of those Indian things and

25:46.560 --> 25:50.540
that identity. and I remember being a

25:50.540 --> 25:52.880
little girl and my mother always used to

25:52.880 --> 25:55.820
keep our hair in braids and we used to

25:55.820 --> 25:57.780
play in front of the store and the white

25:57.780 --> 26:00.520
tourists would ask us for photographs and

26:00.520 --> 26:02.020
sometimes they'd give us money for it and

26:02.020 --> 26:04.780
sometimes they wouldn't. But we thought it

26:04.780 --> 26:06.600
was all fun and good and we'd get like

26:06.600 --> 26:09.540
five bucks out of the deal. And basically

26:09.540 --> 26:11.120
I guess they would come to the reservation

26:11.120 --> 26:14.480
on their way to Yellowstone Park to see

26:14.480 --> 26:17.320
Indians and they saw us, which is sort of

26:17.320 --> 26:19.120
funny because we're Kiowa and Comanche.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.720
We're not Shoshone or Arapaho from the

26:21.720 --> 26:28.500
reservation, you know. And so part of what

26:28.500 --> 26:32.580
my mother does is she sells herself along

26:32.580 --> 26:36.620
with the arts and crafts. She dresses sort

26:36.620 --> 26:38.000
of like the old ladies on the reservation

26:38.000 --> 26:39.840
dress, and she's always dressed like that

26:39.840 --> 26:41.260
from as long as I can remember, like

26:41.260 --> 26:46.200
before I was born. and that is one of the

26:46.200 --> 26:49.700
biggest selling points to the things that

26:49.700 --> 26:51.460
she sells in her store. She's now in Santa

26:51.460 --> 26:54.560
Fe. And last summer when I was in Santa Fe

26:54.560 --> 26:56.040
visiting, I was hanging out in the store

26:56.040 --> 26:59.960
with her and she was standing there and my

26:59.960 --> 27:03.640
mother's like, you know, 60 now and she

27:03.640 --> 27:05.560
was standing there and this white woman

27:05.560 --> 27:07.760
came in and saw her and thought she was

27:07.760 --> 27:09.540
just the cutest thing in the world and ran

27:09.540 --> 27:11.160
right over to her and grabbed a hold of

27:11.160 --> 27:12.800
her braids and sort of yanked on them and

27:12.800 --> 27:15.020
said, oh, you're so cute, you're so cute.

27:15.740 --> 27:19.560
And I remember looking at that and just

27:19.560 --> 27:21.640
being obviously appalled and wanting to

27:21.640 --> 27:25.220
hit this woman. But my mom, who deals with

27:25.220 --> 27:28.020
this on a daily basis, was very composed

27:28.020 --> 27:29.780
and said to her, please don't touch my

27:29.780 --> 27:32.880
hair. And I saw over this woman's face a

27:32.880 --> 27:34.480
sudden realization that she was dealing

27:34.480 --> 27:36.940
with a human being and not a doll, not

27:36.940 --> 27:39.920
this cute little Indian woman to be

27:39.920 --> 27:41.940
fondled or touched or bought or whatever.

27:42.580 --> 27:47.840
And I don't know, so that's what's led me

27:47.840 --> 27:50.460
to look into these, to look into what

27:50.460 --> 27:54.240
we're seen as and how we create ourselves

27:54.240 --> 27:56.380
the way that my mother has created herself

27:56.380 --> 27:58.400
because in a way she's brought this upon

27:58.400 --> 28:01.600
herself. I mean she could dress like a

28:01.600 --> 28:04.940
white person and blend in and she doesn't.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.140
She sticks herself out and she does it for

28:07.140 --> 28:11.720
survival. And it's more than just survival

28:11.720 --> 28:16.240
of money. It's cultural survival also. And

28:16.240 --> 28:22.440
so let's see. So I've been working on this

28:22.440 --> 28:25.700
research for like almost two years now.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.200
And I've come up with this really huge

28:28.200 --> 28:31.660
bibliography. Part of it is annotated and

28:31.660 --> 28:33.980
part of it is unannotated. The last six

28:33.980 --> 28:36.620
pages are unannotated. And it's all

28:36.620 --> 28:39.600
information, books, periodicals, articles,

28:39.860 --> 28:42.360
films that I've come up with that all deal

28:42.360 --> 28:45.520
with this issue in one way or another. And

28:45.520 --> 28:48.080
I'd be happy to give this out. I'd really

28:48.080 --> 28:50.080
like this information to get out there. I

28:50.080 --> 28:52.260
hold no claim to it at all. The more

28:52.260 --> 28:53.920
people who look at it and think about it,

28:53.980 --> 28:56.840
the better. And the one thing that I found

28:56.840 --> 28:59.000
and the way that I structured my course

28:59.000 --> 29:03.260
was is there's two approaches to Indian

29:03.260 --> 29:06.200
images and Indian identity from the

29:06.200 --> 29:09.520
outside. And the first one comes from a

29:09.520 --> 29:11.660
white perspective which looks at the

29:11.660 --> 29:14.020
images as created by white people and

29:14.020 --> 29:19.400
imposed. And then there's in the last, I'd

29:19.400 --> 29:22.540
say maybe even ten years, not even that

29:22.540 --> 29:24.400
long, there's a whole bunch of Indian

29:24.400 --> 29:26.640
research and Indian writing and thinking

29:26.640 --> 29:33.680
that sees Indian identity as that we have

29:33.680 --> 29:35.820
agency in creating our Indian identity,

29:35.860 --> 29:37.560
the way that my mother dresses up and

29:37.560 --> 29:43.120
sells herself. yourself. And so, what was

29:43.120 --> 29:43.700
I going to say?

29:48.700 --> 29:50.980
Oh, one of the films that I'm looking at

29:50.980 --> 29:54.100
is by a Hopi filmmaker. His name is Victor

29:54.100 --> 29:56.140
Masayeswa. I'm probably totally

29:56.140 --> 29:58.880
slaughtering that name. But he did this

29:58.880 --> 30:01.840
film called Imagining Indians and it's an

30:01.840 --> 30:03.820
excellent film. And it brings up issues

30:03.820 --> 30:07.540
that for Native Americans, which is not a

30:07.540 --> 30:11.700
lot, most of what I found doesn't bring up

30:11.700 --> 30:14.760
those issues for Native Americans and what

30:14.760 --> 30:18.900
he writes about or what he what he

30:18.900 --> 30:21.980
visually shows is Indians dealing with

30:21.980 --> 30:25.400
this this thing of having responsibility

30:25.400 --> 30:29.760
for what we allow to be consumed what we

30:29.760 --> 30:33.480
allow to be be commodified and one of the

30:33.480 --> 30:37.720
things that he talks about is is sacred

30:37.720 --> 30:39.960
items that are now for sale or sacred

30:39.960 --> 30:42.360
items that have been turned into tourists

30:42.360 --> 30:45.560
tourist items like pipe bags or something

30:45.560 --> 30:51.380
like that and how we help that we help the

30:51.380 --> 30:54.880
we help we help in losing the sacred of

30:54.880 --> 30:57.700
our communities by by by doing that, by

30:57.700 --> 31:00.180
allowing things to be commodified. And

31:00.180 --> 31:02.740
it's something that I personally have a

31:02.740 --> 31:04.360
lot of interest in because I'm a

31:04.360 --> 31:07.000
beadworker. It's like I haven't had a real

31:07.000 --> 31:09.900
job for the last, I don't know, five or

31:09.900 --> 31:11.780
six years. And I've made most of my money

31:11.780 --> 31:14.600
in the last few years on beadwork. And

31:14.600 --> 31:19.600
what I create holds huge implications.

31:20.780 --> 31:23.560
What I decide to allow to be sold, the

31:23.560 --> 31:28.680
designs I decide to use, it can be

31:28.680 --> 31:31.640
extremely appropriative and a really

31:31.640 --> 31:33.580
sticky situation the more I think about

31:33.580 --> 31:39.340
it. So he talks about, Victor Masayeswa

31:39.340 --> 31:42.580
talks about this responsibility that we

31:42.580 --> 31:44.660
have as Indian people to our own identity

31:44.660 --> 31:50.620
and keeping the sacred sacred and using

31:50.620 --> 31:55.640
our good judgment, using not letting money

31:55.640 --> 31:57.820
talk all the time. And it's a really

31:57.820 --> 31:59.680
difficult lesson for me to learn because

31:59.680 --> 32:02.860
I'm poor and I really need the money. But

32:02.860 --> 32:05.700
I don't know.

32:09.420 --> 32:14.660
Let's see. I don't know like what else to

32:14.660 --> 32:17.000
say about this. I'm teaching this class

32:17.000 --> 32:18.640
and unfortunately most of the students in

32:18.640 --> 32:20.920
my class are white and I don't think that

32:20.920 --> 32:22.720
we're going to get into those issues that

32:22.720 --> 32:25.600
I would like to get into and they're

32:25.600 --> 32:28.020
really issues that maybe only Indians can

32:28.020 --> 32:29.540
talk about because it's our identity

32:29.540 --> 32:33.180
that's at stake. And we're the ones that

32:33.180 --> 32:36.360
need to take control over the theorizing

32:36.360 --> 32:40.380
and the writing that's done on who we are

32:40.380 --> 32:46.480
and what our image is to the public. And I

32:46.480 --> 32:49.700
don't know. I think I'm going to stop

32:49.700 --> 32:51.420
there because I could go into, like,

32:51.420 --> 32:53.640
greater detail about things, like

32:53.640 --> 32:55.540
particulars that I found out about images,

32:55.660 --> 32:58.380
but, you know, that might be boring.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.280
Thanks, Sherry. Are there questions people

33:04.280 --> 33:05.200
have right off the bat?

33:08.240 --> 33:10.420
You used two terms in your presentation,

33:10.660 --> 33:12.780
sacred and culture. How would you define

33:12.780 --> 33:14.220
those terms? Oh, geez.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.860
Well, I can only answer personally. I

33:24.860 --> 33:27.140
don't know how else to answer, and I can

33:27.140 --> 33:30.900
only answer from experience. And identity

33:30.900 --> 33:35.240
is such a twisted thing in America, and it

33:35.240 --> 33:37.740
has to do with race and for Indians it has

33:37.740 --> 33:40.920
to do with blood quantum. And for me, my

33:40.920 --> 33:44.040
understanding is I've seen Indians that

33:44.040 --> 33:45.560
aren't really Indians, you know what I

33:45.560 --> 33:46.640
mean? Blood quantum, they're not

33:46.640 --> 33:48.260
recognized and it's the culture that ends

33:48.260 --> 33:50.200
up ultimately defining how they're

33:50.200 --> 33:56.640
received by their communities. And so in a

33:56.640 --> 33:59.960
way I think that culture... Do I sound

33:59.960 --> 34:01.100
like an anthropologist? I don't know,

34:01.140 --> 34:03.900
maybe I do. But I think that culture

34:03.900 --> 34:08.760
really defines a great deal of our

34:08.760 --> 34:11.240
identity, obviously. And what was the

34:11.240 --> 34:12.920
other term? Sacred.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.360
Now that's really sticky. That's like

34:18.360 --> 34:19.060
terribly sticky.

34:23.020 --> 34:27.940
Well, Well, the way that Victor was using

34:27.940 --> 34:33.440
it in this film was those things that are

34:33.440 --> 34:37.220
central to our identity. And those things

34:37.220 --> 34:38.880
that are central to our identity can be

34:38.880 --> 34:41.440
seen as culture. They can also be seen as

34:41.440 --> 34:44.060
a form of faith or religion. I don't like

34:44.060 --> 34:45.620
the word religion. It seems too

34:45.620 --> 34:47.640
institutional. I like the word faith

34:47.640 --> 34:49.820
better, because it can come in any form.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.840
And I think that they're sacred for all

34:52.840 --> 34:55.600
people, not just Indians, obviously. And I

34:55.600 --> 34:58.280
don't know, I guess that's how I define

34:58.280 --> 34:59.620
it. I don't know if that answered your

34:59.620 --> 34:59.900
question.

35:04.020 --> 35:07.420
I have a question. When you're teaching in

35:07.420 --> 35:09.820
this group, and you're the white students

35:09.820 --> 35:13.760
there, are you getting the sense from them

35:13.760 --> 35:16.080
that they're reinforcing those ideas is

35:16.080 --> 35:20.240
about objectifying Indians as a commercial

35:20.240 --> 35:22.980
commodity? Are you trying to undo it? Do

35:22.980 --> 35:25.400
you see that coming from them? Are they

35:25.400 --> 35:27.740
wanting to take that and again go out and

35:27.740 --> 35:31.080
learn enough to again follow that path?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.840
I've only had one class meeting, so I

35:34.840 --> 35:38.200
can't tell you. I know it's kind of an

35:38.200 --> 35:41.000
unfair question. But just even thinking

35:41.000 --> 35:42.560
about it, because I always teach in

35:42.560 --> 35:44.040
classes that I've heard and I would like

35:44.040 --> 35:50.440
to use those two. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you

35:50.440 --> 35:52.380
know, my hope is that I won't be

35:52.380 --> 35:54.720
reinforcing the stereotypes. And I think

35:54.720 --> 35:58.340
that the strategy that I'm going to use is

35:58.340 --> 36:00.820
to constantly refer back to myself because

36:00.820 --> 36:04.060
I'm a living model, right, standing in

36:04.060 --> 36:05.880
front of them, breathing in front of them.

36:06.060 --> 36:09.400
And I have these stories. Hopefully they

36:09.400 --> 36:10.840
won't get bored by them. But I have all

36:10.840 --> 36:15.260
these stories of what, how, I mean my

36:15.260 --> 36:16.800
mom's in the art business and the art

36:16.800 --> 36:18.900
business is all about identity. It's all

36:18.900 --> 36:21.540
about image. I mean image is the first

36:21.540 --> 36:24.140
thing that sells. The art comes later. And

36:24.140 --> 36:27.580
if I can in some way use my life as an

36:27.580 --> 36:32.820
example to show them maybe insights that

36:32.820 --> 36:35.020
they're not going to get by reading, you

36:35.020 --> 36:36.500
know, there's a really excellent book

36:36.500 --> 36:37.800
called The White Man's Indian. I'm sure

36:37.800 --> 36:40.500
you know it. at Burkhofer and you can't

36:40.500 --> 36:42.120
get that from Burkhofer, you know what I

36:42.120 --> 36:43.180
mean? It comes from a different

36:43.180 --> 36:46.540
perspective. So I just hope by just

36:46.540 --> 36:50.260
physically being there is going to push

36:50.260 --> 36:54.380
it, push the issue past those stereotypes.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.000
I don't know if it's going to work or not.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.200
I've heard all kinds of horror stories

36:58.200 --> 37:00.460
about how it doesn't work, so we'll see.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.360
Do you want to talk about how your course

37:02.360 --> 37:04.560
design addresses this issue as well in

37:04.560 --> 37:05.760
terms of the first half and the second

37:05.760 --> 37:08.500
half? the films you're using? Yeah, the

37:08.500 --> 37:15.440
first half of the course is all work

37:15.440 --> 37:20.040
written by non-Indians. And the film, I'm

37:20.040 --> 37:23.700
only showing one film, is Thunderheart.

37:24.060 --> 37:27.140
And they come from the white perspective.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.100
And some of them, it's just some of it's

37:29.100 --> 37:31.000
really excellent work. And I really

37:31.000 --> 37:33.120
appreciate that. Some of it is very

37:33.120 --> 37:36.020
controversial. controversial and I really

37:36.020 --> 37:38.600
appreciate that too. And hopefully in the

37:38.600 --> 37:41.220
class we can see how controversial and how

37:42.860 --> 37:45.420
almost like polar opposite it is from the

37:45.420 --> 37:49.420
Indian created writing and analysis, which

37:49.420 --> 37:51.700
is the second half of the course. And I'm

37:51.700 --> 37:55.500
using three films. They're all films by

37:55.500 --> 37:57.360
Indian people. Navajo Talking Pictures,

37:57.580 --> 37:59.140
Imagining Indians, and Herald of Orange.

37:59.380 --> 38:03.200
And I think I mean, in particular,

38:03.480 --> 38:06.600
Imagining Indians and Herald of Orange are

38:06.600 --> 38:08.900
like two of, like they, when I watched

38:08.900 --> 38:10.300
Imagining Indians for the first time, I

38:10.300 --> 38:11.940
was like, yes, this is exactly what I want

38:11.940 --> 38:13.480
to try to get across in my course, this

38:13.480 --> 38:15.700
film. And if they can understand that film

38:15.700 --> 38:18.000
by the end of the class, I'll be really

38:18.000 --> 38:20.060
happy. I'll be really happy I'll have

38:20.060 --> 38:20.460
succeeded.

38:24.280 --> 38:29.980
I think you answered my question. In

38:29.980 --> 38:32.600
helping to deal with issues of identity,

38:33.180 --> 38:35.720
it seems like you have a couple audiences,

38:36.040 --> 38:42.080
one non-Indians as well. And so I was

38:42.080 --> 38:48.140
wondering in class how you can, part of

38:48.140 --> 38:52.420
that would be the law of the team. I was

38:52.420 --> 38:55.220
wondering how you can do that, make that

38:55.220 --> 38:59.340
powerful. Right. I think you may have

38:59.340 --> 39:00.760
already answered my question.

39:04.260 --> 39:07.660
The class is a discussion class. It is not

39:07.660 --> 39:10.820
a lecture class. class. I cannot imagine

39:10.820 --> 39:13.700
myself lecturing. Like that just seems

39:13.700 --> 39:18.660
really foreign to me. So, and the other

39:18.660 --> 39:19.940
thing that I have going for me is I'm a

39:19.940 --> 39:22.400
student. I'm totally equal level. I don't

39:22.400 --> 39:24.240
have an office. I don't have, you know, a

39:24.240 --> 39:26.400
super like professors box at the steno

39:26.400 --> 39:27.920
pool or whatever. Well, actually that's

39:27.920 --> 39:32.700
not true. I do. But anyway, it's like

39:32.700 --> 39:34.920
almost a level playing field that I'm

39:34.920 --> 39:37.200
coming from that that professors don't

39:37.200 --> 39:41.240
have. And I hope that, I mean, when we're

39:41.240 --> 39:43.340
out in the real world, isn't that when we

39:43.340 --> 39:45.260
connect with another person, when we

39:45.260 --> 39:47.500
really connect, it's when we feel like

39:47.500 --> 39:49.820
we're on a level playing field, when we

39:49.820 --> 39:53.220
can really hear what they're saying. So

39:53.220 --> 39:54.880
I'm hoping that that's going to come

39:54.880 --> 39:58.180
through. I don't know. We'll see. At the

39:58.180 --> 39:59.540
end of the quarter, when I'm not

39:59.540 --> 40:01.100
graduating, because my class is a total

40:01.100 --> 40:04.740
failure, we'll see. When my students hate

40:04.740 --> 40:08.760
my guts. I think I'm taking the hard line.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.100
I just wanted to ask you if you have any

40:13.100 --> 40:16.700
questions from your experience. If you

40:16.700 --> 40:19.320
might want to ask, pose any questions here

40:19.320 --> 40:21.820
since we have all kind of different people

40:21.820 --> 40:26.000
here in the room with the wide points of

40:26.000 --> 40:26.200
view.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.180
Well, I don't know. I guess my question

40:36.180 --> 40:40.880
would be, I

40:40.880 --> 40:44.200
keep coming back to this film by Victor

40:44.200 --> 40:46.060
Masayesva, which it just, it's an

40:46.060 --> 40:48.080
incredible film and I recommend it to

40:48.080 --> 40:52.200
anyone, everyone. everyone. And he shows

40:52.200 --> 40:58.840
the scene of these paintings on a rock

40:58.840 --> 41:03.820
wall and he's talking about like looking

41:03.820 --> 41:07.700
back through time how once we used to make

41:07.700 --> 41:10.600
these things for survival, for life, and

41:10.600 --> 41:12.580
then somewhere along the line money

41:12.580 --> 41:14.540
started to be exchanged for these items.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.240
And then somewhere along the line after

41:17.240 --> 41:20.420
that we stopped claiming responsibility

41:20.420 --> 41:24.600
for that whole process of exchange for

41:24.600 --> 41:27.560
survival. Maybe not seeing it or seeing it

41:27.560 --> 41:29.120
in the same light or not seeing it in the

41:29.120 --> 41:35.220
same light. And I just wonder, like I

41:35.220 --> 41:37.640
said, it's a really difficult question for

41:37.640 --> 41:39.980
me to deal with. Like my own

41:39.980 --> 41:43.040
responsibility to what I do, to the art

41:43.040 --> 41:47.880
that I do. And, but

41:47.880 --> 41:50.340
at the same instance, I do feel this

41:50.340 --> 41:52.500
responsibility to the sacred, whatever the

41:52.500 --> 41:56.620
heck that is, I don't know. And I don't

41:56.620 --> 41:58.660
know, I guess my question is, what do

41:58.660 --> 42:03.320
people think about that? I mean, it's, of

42:03.320 --> 42:05.380
course, I think, like, people have always,

42:05.500 --> 42:07.080
Indian people have always done that. But

42:07.080 --> 42:09.160
to a certain extent, like with the, I can

42:09.160 --> 42:10.780
see it in the movie industry better than

42:10.780 --> 42:16.700
any other industry, is Indian film stars

42:16.700 --> 42:18.960
walking into roles that maybe are not the

42:18.960 --> 42:21.760
best roles to be walking into. And doing

42:21.760 --> 42:25.400
it for money. And then not liking to hear

42:25.400 --> 42:27.100
any criticism of them coming from the

42:27.100 --> 42:28.660
Indian community for doing that. And

42:28.660 --> 42:30.920
saying, oh well, the Indian community is

42:30.920 --> 42:32.740
poor and this is a way that I'm getting

42:32.740 --> 42:37.060
out of it. but in a way it compromises our

42:37.060 --> 42:41.940
identity. Can I just add something to that

42:41.940 --> 42:43.660
based on some conversations that we've had

42:43.660 --> 42:45.300
in my office that she hasn't quite said it

42:45.300 --> 42:47.440
this way, but I think some of the things

42:47.440 --> 42:49.760
that I've learned from Terry in terms of

42:49.760 --> 42:51.320
the questions that she's asking that she's

42:51.320 --> 42:53.820
posing to the people in this room is that

42:53.820 --> 42:57.020
it's one thing for us to stand up and

42:57.020 --> 42:58.740
lament the commodification of Indian

42:58.740 --> 43:00.120
culture or the inappropriate

43:00.120 --> 43:04.000
appropriations

43:04.000 --> 43:05.320
committed in the name of New Age

43:05.320 --> 43:07.780
spirituality and on down the list. But

43:07.780 --> 43:09.600
what happens when we acknowledge that

43:09.600 --> 43:12.180
Indian people, both today and in the past,

43:12.240 --> 43:14.720
have been active participants? Not all

43:14.720 --> 43:16.280
Indian people, but there have been some.

43:16.620 --> 43:18.000
What do we do when we acknowledge that

43:18.000 --> 43:19.460
Indian people have been participating in

43:19.460 --> 43:21.080
that? And the question is not a question

43:21.080 --> 43:22.860
of politics. It's not a question of laying

43:22.860 --> 43:24.860
blame, so much as it's an intellectual

43:24.860 --> 43:27.160
question, which is to ask, what's going on

43:27.160 --> 43:29.520
culturally? What's the significance of

43:29.520 --> 43:31.940
that? It's not that by acknowledging that

43:31.940 --> 43:33.400
Indian people have been participating in

43:33.400 --> 43:35.640
it that thereby we can't blame non-Indians

43:35.640 --> 43:38.240
for what they're doing. It's an

43:38.240 --> 43:39.920
intellectual question, as I understand the

43:39.920 --> 43:41.460
way you're approaching it. She's really

43:41.460 --> 43:42.760
asking the question, what does this mean

43:42.760 --> 43:45.020
for us? What does this mean about Indian

43:45.020 --> 43:47.780
culture? What does it tell us? What kinds

43:47.780 --> 43:50.140
of questions does it ask? I haven't heard

43:50.140 --> 43:51.380
you say it quite that way today, but

43:51.380 --> 43:52.420
that's what I've picked up in our

43:52.420 --> 43:54.580
conversations as you worked on this

43:54.580 --> 43:58.080
research. I'll make a quick comment and

43:58.080 --> 44:01.120
then give them to other questions. I think

44:01.120 --> 44:05.000
it illustrates to Terry and James that it

44:05.000 --> 44:08.940
represents a crisis intellectually, but

44:08.940 --> 44:10.040
also at the level of responsibility.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.480
There's a moment, I think we've been

44:11.480 --> 44:15.020
talking about the same film, of Rodney

44:15.020 --> 44:17.380
Grant from Dance with Wolves, making a

44:17.380 --> 44:19.420
comment in that film, it's the same one,

44:19.480 --> 44:23.460
right? and where Victor poses to him the

44:23.460 --> 44:25.120
question about commodifying himself,

44:25.360 --> 44:27.320
basically. What roles do you take? Which

44:27.320 --> 44:30.840
ones do you not take? And one of the

44:30.840 --> 44:33.640
questions is, well, are you going to take

44:33.640 --> 44:35.600
responsibility for creating Native

44:35.600 --> 44:38.020
American film industry, for films by

44:38.020 --> 44:40.540
Native American directors like Victor?

44:40.740 --> 44:44.020
Would you take $5,000 to do a film with me

44:44.020 --> 44:45.740
instead of $1,000,000 to do a film over

44:45.740 --> 44:50.260
here? And Rodney Grant ends up sort of

44:50.260 --> 44:53.520
avoiding the question. He doesn't want to

44:53.520 --> 44:55.900
talk about it. And there's a way in which

44:55.900 --> 45:00.180
that film problematizes for me an

45:00.180 --> 45:03.180
avoidance of a real crisis. And why I

45:03.180 --> 45:04.720
think it's a really interesting topic to

45:04.720 --> 45:08.600
bring up is there's also not among Indian

45:08.600 --> 45:13.620
writers enough theorizing about this

45:13.620 --> 45:15.860
question of responsibility. because it's a

45:15.860 --> 45:19.300
really difficult issue. And teaching is

45:19.300 --> 45:20.740
actually one of those places where you

45:20.740 --> 45:23.140
have to confront it. And you'll find that

45:23.140 --> 45:25.000
out, and everyone here who has taught

45:25.000 --> 45:28.600
finds that out as well, where generally

45:28.600 --> 45:30.660
you are in situations where you are

45:30.660 --> 45:33.460
somehow standing in as a representative of

45:33.460 --> 45:35.740
lots and lots of people and lots of points

45:35.740 --> 45:37.280
of view. No matter how much you don't want

45:37.280 --> 45:39.200
to be, that's the situation you're faced

45:39.200 --> 45:42.000
with as a teacher. And so you'll have to

45:42.000 --> 45:43.620
confront it at that point. There's a

45:43.620 --> 45:45.620
wonderful side of that. There's also a

45:45.620 --> 45:48.520
really sticky part of it, too. And I find

45:48.520 --> 45:50.400
that those people who really want to

45:50.400 --> 45:52.120
embrace that and say, yeah, I want to be

45:52.120 --> 45:54.620
that person, that's when you run into

45:54.620 --> 45:56.540
problems. If you're too eager to go into

45:56.540 --> 45:57.540
that situation and say, yeah, I'll

45:57.540 --> 46:00.040
represent the Indian voice to all of these

46:00.040 --> 46:04.080
people. So it's a huge issue that will

46:04.080 --> 46:06.820
probably come up all day. We'll move on to

46:06.820 --> 46:07.560
some other questions.

46:11.580 --> 46:16.360
You bring out many deep questions, many

46:16.360 --> 46:18.860
deep issues. I'm not sure that I

46:18.860 --> 46:20.700
understand everything, but there is one

46:20.700 --> 46:22.980
issue that you bring out and really

46:22.980 --> 46:26.120
touched me. It's the question of art and

46:26.120 --> 46:30.080
money. Because I'm a person who paints,

46:30.440 --> 46:36.340
and I use painting to know it more myself,

46:36.340 --> 46:39.200
and also to try to come in with other

46:39.200 --> 46:42.640
person to share what I know or what I

46:42.640 --> 46:45.860
don't know with my art. And you just

46:45.860 --> 46:49.380
involve the question of sending because we

46:49.380 --> 46:52.500
have to survive. I need to leave the art

46:52.500 --> 46:55.700
that I'm doing. And presently, I'm not

46:55.700 --> 46:58.900
ready to send my art because I don't know

46:58.900 --> 47:02.500
exactly why. And I'm not ready to paint to

47:02.500 --> 47:05.860
please the public when they watch because

47:05.860 --> 47:09.500
the art for me is something more deep. And

47:09.500 --> 47:11.160
I understand a little bit you when you

47:11.160 --> 47:13.380
involve this question, but I don't have

47:13.380 --> 47:16.100
all the answers. But I just share your

47:16.100 --> 47:20.960
fear with this, because in art I think

47:20.960 --> 47:24.900
there is something very deep, and it's

47:24.900 --> 47:27.140
really personal, but at the same time, I

47:27.140 --> 47:29.700
think that there is something universal in

47:29.700 --> 47:33.540
art. There is a kind of spirit inside art,

47:33.540 --> 47:38.380
art, then with

47:38.380 --> 47:40.080
money there is something that I don't

47:40.080 --> 47:43.280
understand. That's what I wanted to say.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.740
Yeah, my presentation last time, which I

47:48.740 --> 47:51.180
will try not to get into, basically dealt

47:51.180 --> 47:55.360
with this about Indian art. Because Indian

47:55.360 --> 47:58.900
art is really defined in many different

47:58.900 --> 48:01.740
ways, and it's defined by time. And

48:01.740 --> 48:05.000
antique Indian art is worth way more than

48:05.000 --> 48:08.260
Indian art presently made. But then within

48:08.260 --> 48:10.640
the presently made Indian art, certain

48:10.640 --> 48:13.440
types of art are considered crafts that

48:13.440 --> 48:15.840
anybody can do. Bead work, feather work,

48:16.440 --> 48:18.400
wood work, anything like that. And then

48:18.400 --> 48:20.960
there's another type of art that is

48:20.960 --> 48:23.820
considered fine art or high art. Pottery,

48:23.980 --> 48:28.160
modern paintings, baskets, like that. and

48:28.160 --> 48:29.580
there will be, like if you go into Santa

48:29.580 --> 48:30.960
Fe, there's like one whole gallery

48:30.960 --> 48:32.800
dedicated just to pots, and they're not

48:32.800 --> 48:35.260
old pots. They're pots that are currently

48:35.260 --> 48:38.580
made. And my question is, why isn't there

48:38.580 --> 48:42.120
a store dedicated also to beadwork? There

48:42.120 --> 48:47.360
is, but it's mass-produced beadwork. And I

48:47.360 --> 48:51.240
just, I question, like, what's going on

48:51.240 --> 48:55.040
there just within the market itself that

48:55.040 --> 48:58.660
defines what art is. And there's something

48:58.660 --> 49:01.240
coming up on the thing about looking at

49:01.240 --> 49:04.320
Indian history and something about terms

49:04.320 --> 49:07.780
in Indian history. And I think that part

49:07.780 --> 49:10.900
of that, yeah, problematizing the term of

49:10.900 --> 49:13.060
traditional culture, because a lot of the

49:13.060 --> 49:15.880
modern artwork that's being made by

49:15.880 --> 49:18.720
Indians is traditionally based, but maybe

49:18.720 --> 49:20.400
not like, you know, beaded tennis shoes or

49:20.400 --> 49:21.420
something like that with traditional

49:21.420 --> 49:23.460
designs on it. It's like how do you define

49:23.460 --> 49:25.680
that and how does the market define that?

49:26.780 --> 49:29.300
So we live in, you know, a market-driven

49:29.300 --> 49:32.620
economy and in an art is just like any

49:32.620 --> 49:34.320
other commodity, so we have to deal with

49:34.320 --> 49:38.100
that. Maybe with that we'll let people

49:38.100 --> 49:39.740
comment during lunch and during the breaks

49:39.740 --> 49:42.420
and things to Terry. I thought that was

49:42.420 --> 49:46.680
great, so thank you. Thank you.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.720
For those of you who are following along

49:53.720 --> 49:56.340
the schedule and correlating it with the

49:56.340 --> 50:00.200
watch on the end of your arm, the way

50:00.200 --> 50:01.260
we're going to deal with the time, we

50:01.260 --> 50:02.800
start at about 15 minutes late, and we're

50:02.800 --> 50:05.120
just going to be about 15 minutes behind,

50:05.200 --> 50:07.120
and we'll have lunch at about 12.15. So

50:07.120 --> 50:09.760
you don't have to get nervous or antsy if

50:09.760 --> 50:11.540
we're running still about 10 minutes

50:11.540 --> 50:14.340
behind. That's our plan for right now. Our

50:14.340 --> 50:17.580
next speaker is Jacob Manitoul Bailey, Sac

50:17.580 --> 50:21.140
and Fox. And I wish Jacob were an American

50:21.140 --> 50:23.480
Studies major. He's taken a lot of courses

50:23.480 --> 50:25.540
in American Studies, but unfortunately he

50:25.540 --> 50:27.560
was seduced by the Community Studies Board

50:28.160 --> 50:30.200
because they would allow him to do a six

50:30.200 --> 50:33.740
-month field internship, and he's going to

50:33.740 --> 50:38.700
be going to Oklahoma to work with the Sac

50:38.700 --> 50:41.620
and Fox at the end of the spring quarter.

50:41.620 --> 50:43.520
Is that right? He won't be back until the

50:43.520 --> 50:47.420
first of the year. And he's been involved

50:47.420 --> 50:50.180
in a number of projects on campus and one

50:50.180 --> 50:52.820
of the most important has to do with the

50:52.820 --> 50:57.780
repatriation process at UC Santa Cruz. He

50:57.780 --> 51:00.980
has been doing an internship and has

51:00.980 --> 51:02.920
learned a great deal about art

51:02.920 --> 51:04.520
collections. Probably the second most

51:04.520 --> 51:06.100
knowledgeable person on the campus right

51:06.100 --> 51:09.260
now about the small collection that we

51:09.260 --> 51:12.980
have of Indian remains at UC Santa Cruz,

51:13.240 --> 51:17.900
and has also taken it in his own

51:17.900 --> 51:21.200
characteristically intellectual way,

51:21.320 --> 51:24.240
raising some very broad questions about

51:24.240 --> 51:29.900
the relationship, both institutional and

51:29.900 --> 51:32.260
intellectual, between the discipline of

51:32.260 --> 51:33.980
anthropology and the American Indian

51:33.980 --> 51:36.460
community, and so has a number of

51:36.460 --> 51:38.180
interesting points to raise. and he's

51:38.180 --> 51:40.600
going to talk about the whole repatriation

51:40.600 --> 51:45.360
situation at UCSC. Jacob? Well, I might

51:45.360 --> 51:46.840
get that far. I'm not sure yet.

51:49.860 --> 51:53.840
One of my nicknames for Terry is Boss, and

51:53.840 --> 51:56.640
I tell you that because I'm going to be

51:56.640 --> 52:00.120
following a lot of what she said and what

52:00.120 --> 52:02.740
I want to discuss today. day. And

52:02.740 --> 52:05.820
repatriation

52:05.820 --> 52:10.240
as it has been defined stands for, and

52:10.240 --> 52:12.980
this is a legal definition, the return of

52:12.980 --> 52:16.220
sacred objects, human remains,

52:16.560 --> 52:20.240
unassociated funerary goods, and items of

52:20.240 --> 52:22.800
of cultural patrimony to American Indian

52:22.800 --> 52:23.300
nations.

52:27.840 --> 52:31.080
And repatriation currently is largely

52:31.720 --> 52:33.780
discussed within the terms and defined

52:33.780 --> 52:36.940
within the terms of NAGPRA, which is the

52:36.940 --> 52:39.340
Native American Graves Repatriation and

52:39.340 --> 52:41.400
Protection Act, which was passed in 1990.

52:43.700 --> 52:46.680
And I say I want to follow Terry because I

52:46.680 --> 52:50.300
I want to talk about images, stereotypes,

52:50.960 --> 52:54.180
assumptions, responsibility, a lot of the

52:54.180 --> 52:54.800
same issues.

52:58.180 --> 53:00.900
And I also want to follow her by starting

53:00.900 --> 53:05.240
with a story about my mother. Because when

53:05.240 --> 53:08.360
my mother was going to school, there was

53:08.360 --> 53:10.280
no such thing as Native American studies.

53:10.580 --> 53:12.180
There was no such thing as Indian

53:12.180 --> 53:14.880
education. If you wanted to have anything

53:14.880 --> 53:16.740
to do with Indians in the college setting,

53:16.840 --> 53:22.560
he went into anthropology. And a lot of

53:22.560 --> 53:25.060
Indians went into anthropology and some of

53:25.060 --> 53:28.100
them made it and a lot more didn't make

53:28.100 --> 53:31.420
it. And my mom was one of those. She

53:31.420 --> 53:34.720
dropped out of college and I grew up with

53:34.720 --> 53:36.700
stories about the crazy things that

53:36.700 --> 53:39.480
anthropologists thought about Indians and

53:39.480 --> 53:40.980
the even sicker things that they they did

53:40.980 --> 53:47.040
to our dead. And when I first started, and

53:47.040 --> 53:48.380
I'm really glad that there's a lot of

53:48.380 --> 53:52.400
anthropology students on this sheet. Maybe

53:52.400 --> 53:55.540
we can get a little dialogue going here,

53:55.680 --> 53:56.780
because I have a lot of problems.

54:00.380 --> 54:02.560
I've always grown up with a lot of

54:02.560 --> 54:04.440
assumptions and a lot of stereotypes about

54:04.440 --> 54:09.220
anthropologists. and when I first started

54:09.220 --> 54:15.300
researching repatriation, I uncovered

54:15.300 --> 54:17.740
horror story after horror story about past

54:17.740 --> 54:21.080
and current anthropological practice. And

54:21.080 --> 54:23.340
it reinforced a lot of the ideas I had

54:23.340 --> 54:27.580
about anthropology and what it does and

54:27.580 --> 54:32.060
what it has done to Indian people. And at

54:32.060 --> 54:34.380
the same time I've had sort of a morbid

54:34.380 --> 54:37.480
fascination with the strange creatures and

54:37.480 --> 54:40.400
sort of the rituals that they seem to love

54:40.400 --> 54:44.300
to carry out. And those were the terms

54:44.300 --> 54:47.320
that I thought about anthropology and

54:47.320 --> 54:52.140
anthropologists when I started interning

54:52.140 --> 54:54.980
at the University of California Santa Cruz

54:54.980 --> 54:56.200
Archaeological Collection.

54:59.900 --> 55:05.140
The repatriation debate, and I shouldn't

55:05.140 --> 55:07.080
use the word debate, I shouldn't even use

55:07.080 --> 55:08.580
the word movement, I should use the word

55:08.580 --> 55:12.520
war, because that's the way that both a

55:12.520 --> 55:14.500
lot of Natives and a lot of non-Natives

55:14.500 --> 55:17.900
writing about repatriation have defined

55:17.900 --> 55:20.900
it. They've defined it as a war, as a war

55:20.900 --> 55:24.460
of science versus religion, a war of

55:24.460 --> 55:26.620
objective, cold, analytical

55:26.620 --> 55:30.420
anthropologists versus warm, spiritual

55:30.420 --> 55:35.300
Indians. Indians. And a lot of the titles

55:35.300 --> 55:39.380
of articles written by both Natives and

55:39.380 --> 55:42.000
non-Natives, a lot of prominent people are

55:42.000 --> 55:44.780
things like science or sacrilege,

55:45.080 --> 55:48.200
disputing the dead, preservation or

55:48.200 --> 55:51.460
reburial, Native Americans versus American

55:51.460 --> 55:56.100
museums, a battle for artifacts. And so

55:56.100 --> 56:00.940
this This is the mindset that prevails in

56:00.940 --> 56:03.140
a lot of places, and it was the mindset

56:03.140 --> 56:07.200
that I had when I started interning at the

56:07.200 --> 56:09.920
anthropology department. That was an

56:09.920 --> 56:13.220
extremely difficult process for me. You

56:13.220 --> 56:15.700
walk into this building. It's called

56:15.700 --> 56:18.160
Social Sciences I. I normally refer to it

56:18.160 --> 56:20.900
as the evil building. And it's this big

56:20.900 --> 56:24.800
concrete monolith. You know, you walk up

56:24.800 --> 56:27.440
two stairs of floor, the air starts to get

56:27.440 --> 56:32.040
stale. The posters start to appear on the

56:32.040 --> 56:35.760
wall. Paleolithic culture and plains

56:35.760 --> 56:40.840
material items in the faunal area. You

56:40.840 --> 56:43.340
know, people are talking in languages that

56:43.340 --> 56:45.640
I can't understand. And I get to the

56:45.640 --> 56:47.380
fourth floor where they keep the bodies,

56:47.580 --> 56:49.480
and I start getting pretty whacked out.

56:52.100 --> 56:57.640
When I first started my internship, I

56:57.640 --> 56:59.760
could only think of things in either-or

56:59.760 --> 57:03.680
situations. It was either I go in there

57:03.680 --> 57:07.940
and I lay my agenda out on the table, or I

57:07.940 --> 57:10.780
hide it and I compromise my sense of

57:10.780 --> 57:15.720
integrity. And every situation that I

57:15.720 --> 57:18.420
found myself in was a set of either-or

57:18.420 --> 57:20.700
statements, neither of which I was happy

57:20.700 --> 57:26.040
with. And eventually what I was forced to

57:26.040 --> 57:29.620
do for my own sanity and to get anywhere

57:29.620 --> 57:33.040
in working to help the repatriation

57:33.040 --> 57:37.520
process was that I had to go out on a

57:37.520 --> 57:43.100
limb. I had to put myself out there and I

57:43.100 --> 57:46.160
had to explain to my supervisor, who's an

57:46.160 --> 57:49.940
archaeologist, and my my coworker who is

57:49.940 --> 57:54.380
an archaeology student that I had a lot of

57:54.380 --> 57:59.040
fear and a lot of anger about what was

57:59.040 --> 58:04.400
going on. And I was amazed, I was

58:04.400 --> 58:07.640
absolutely amazed at the emotional

58:07.640 --> 58:09.800
responses that I got from those people.

58:09.800 --> 58:13.840
and what they told me about how they felt

58:13.840 --> 58:19.780
and how they had become sick, how they

58:19.780 --> 58:25.440
felt forces, and how hard it was for them

58:25.440 --> 58:30.880
to be involved in such a thing. And we

58:30.880 --> 58:35.340
really begin to build bridges to

58:35.340 --> 58:38.660
facilitate a way of thinking about

58:38.660 --> 58:43.660
repatriation that wasn't us versus them.

58:44.240 --> 58:48.320
It wasn't me carrying a banner going in

58:48.320 --> 58:55.700
there to get rid of anthropology. And I

58:55.700 --> 59:00.720
think that Indians have a lot of

59:00.720 --> 59:02.440
stereotypes about anthropologists.

59:03.360 --> 59:04.960
Anthropologists have a lot of stereotypes

59:04.960 --> 59:08.880
about Indians. And the dominant society

59:08.880 --> 59:12.960
has stereotypes about both of them, which

59:12.960 --> 59:18.020
feed into a rhetoric which divides us. And

59:18.020 --> 59:20.500
this is when it comes to survival and when

59:20.500 --> 59:22.520
it comes to responsibility, like Terry was

59:22.520 --> 59:25.880
talking about, is that anthropologists,

59:26.200 --> 59:30.320
the most of them, When I really sat down

59:30.320 --> 59:33.840
and talked with them, the basic thing that

59:33.840 --> 59:39.720
comes out is that they love Indians. That

59:39.720 --> 59:42.020
they love Indians, that they feel a

59:42.020 --> 59:44.500
responsibility towards Indians, that the

59:44.500 --> 59:46.300
whole reason they went into their field is

59:46.300 --> 59:48.720
because they wanted to help Indians. And

59:48.720 --> 59:50.840
they got into the field and then they

59:50.840 --> 59:56.200
found out that they had to do these

59:56.200 --> 59:59.400
certain things. which wasn't what they

59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.120
thought and they ended up interacting with

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:08.540
objects and with remains and not with live

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:14.200
human beings and repatriation has forced a

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.860
lot of anthropologists to and a lot of

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.720
Indians to get over their fear about each

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.540
other and to come together to work on

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:27.640
projects to to try to to resolve this

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.160
crisis.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.660
And anthropologists, and I use the term so

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.520
generally and so broadly, and I refer to

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.440
such a huge group of people, but there's a

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:49.440
narrative that's emerging which is trying

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.520
to succeed the one that's of us us versus

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.400
them, which says we can work together. And

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.860
we can work together to do some important

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.960
things. So that's the first sort of issue

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.080
I want to pose. The second issue I want to

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.540
pose is...

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:28.700
is about how the rhetoric around

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.700
repatriation

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:38.080
talks about Indians and about how they

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.380
feel about spirits and their ancestors and

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.440
desecration and things like this in a way

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.740
that really disturbs me and it disturbs me

01:01:53.740 --> 01:02:01.500
because it's not tribally specific and

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:08.260
it's not guided by that For instance,

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:12.640
there's a national NAGPRA committee and

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.200
they have field meetings which are helped

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.780
to formulate policy. And at one of these

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:24.840
field meetings there was a presentation

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.680
which represented the Indian viewpoint for

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:34.360
that segment. segment and the people who

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.740
got up there were political activists and

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:44.940
they basically said that all these bones

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.520
need to go back in the ground and we don't

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.640
care what they are. We don't care if

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.940
they're Chinese, we don't care if they're

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.540
Jewish, we don't care what what tribe they

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.360
are. The spirits have been disturbed. The

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.660
spirits have been disturbed. And we need

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.600
to put them at peace.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.280
And repatriation was an intertribal

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.480
movement to deal with some very serious

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.300
issues, dangerous

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.200
issues, powerful issues, things that I

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.700
cannot possibly understand and my solution

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.180
is to look to the people in my community

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:33.800
like I'm going for six months to intern

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.220
with the second Fox repatriation committee

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.260
which is made up of elders and their

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.300
response is that they need to move

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.760
extremely slow they need to be extremely

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.780
careful because they're dealing with very

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:55.960
very powerful and dangerous issues, and

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.500
that they need to be guided by the

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.800
traditional beliefs and the traditional

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.100
ways that have guided them in everything

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:11.460
else they do. And what I see going on a

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.180
lot of other places is these remains,

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:23.280
these ancestors, become a war trophy, we

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.280
will get these
