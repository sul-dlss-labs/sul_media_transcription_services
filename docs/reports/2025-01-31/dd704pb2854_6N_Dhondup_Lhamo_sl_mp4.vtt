and appreciate very much your

02:14.740 --> 02:16.000
participation in the project.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.520
How old are you?

02:27.200 --> 02:27.880
71.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.540
And where are you from in Tibet?

02:36.360 --> 02:43.760
So the place

02:43.760 --> 02:48.380
where I lived was called La Gong. And in

02:48.380 --> 02:50.020
which province was La Gong?

03:04.660 --> 03:10.660
I came to Lhasa in 1961-62 when the

03:10.660 --> 03:12.760
Chinese created a lot of problems.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.080
Where were you born? In which province?

03:36.980 --> 03:40.900
So when you came to Lhasa, you were about

03:40.900 --> 03:41.540
how old?

03:57.960 --> 04:02.120
So I must have been about 36 years old and

04:02.120 --> 04:04.840
when I came to Lhasa I had three children

04:04.840 --> 04:07.820
with me and then three were born in Lhasa.

04:07.820 --> 04:08.560
Okay.

04:10.820 --> 04:15.660
So that's been so long ago. In your

04:15.660 --> 04:18.880
village, what did your father do? We are

04:18.880 --> 04:21.220
going to the forest to collect the

04:21.220 --> 04:22.980
firewood. What are we going to do with the

04:22.980 --> 04:29.540
firewood? We will take it to the forest

04:29.540 --> 04:35.100
and we will dig a hole in the ground. We

04:35.100 --> 04:37.660
will dig a hole. What is the hole? The

04:37.660 --> 04:40.680
hole is the hole. The hole?

04:46.600 --> 04:51.320
So in those days my father was a farmer

04:51.320 --> 04:54.500
working in the commune and then we would

04:54.500 --> 04:59.080
dig up medicinal plants called poppy from

04:59.080 --> 05:04.560
the ground. So you were in a commune, a

05:04.560 --> 05:06.700
Tibetan commune, or was this a Chinese

05:06.700 --> 05:10.080
commune? But George 2013 especialmente té

05:10.080 --> 05:15.120
into

05:15.120 --> 05:32.720
the

05:32.720 --> 05:35.420
Then they would go to the fields and pick

05:35.420 --> 05:38.300
the seeds. And then they would go to the

05:38.300 --> 05:40.660
fields and pick the seeds. And then they

05:40.660 --> 05:42.940
would go to the fields and pick the seeds.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.120
So it was a Tibetan commune run by

05:52.120 --> 05:55.900
Chinese. And the farmers harvested, when

05:55.900 --> 05:58.780
the farmers harvested grains and wheat and

05:58.780 --> 06:01.780
barley, we would have to give them to the

06:01.780 --> 06:04.520
Chinese so being unable to endure the

06:04.520 --> 06:06.780
suffering my husband and I and children

06:06.780 --> 06:09.860
fled or went to went to Lhasa. Went to

06:09.860 --> 06:14.940
Lhasa, right. So what memories do you have

06:14.940 --> 06:17.100
of your childhood when you were a little

06:17.100 --> 06:17.440
girl?

06:32.120 --> 06:34.560
What should I say about when I was little?

06:46.620 --> 06:50.920
I have no memories of my younger days.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.920
Okay. What did your mother do? What about

06:55.920 --> 06:59.120
your zaczyan and located making? In my

06:59.120 --> 07:03.460
province, my daughter was using literally

07:03.460 --> 07:08.780
cotton and I just put some on and but her

07:08.780 --> 07:10.820
Zhaozi is not doing Полной oluyorly. So, i

07:10.820 --> 07:13.860
see that she remembered, but she doesn't

07:13.860 --> 07:18.280
like it, so, as i said before she needs

07:18.280 --> 07:19.320
солн calves

07:36.660 --> 07:41.240
So in the

07:41.240 --> 07:44.460
commune she was, she had the task of

07:44.460 --> 07:47.100
milking and then also you know carrying

07:47.100 --> 07:50.840
hay on the back to be spread under the

07:50.840 --> 07:53.820
horses and mules. And then after we

07:53.820 --> 07:57.520
escaped, I had no idea about them, but I

07:57.520 --> 08:02.340
think they have all passed away now. So

08:02.340 --> 08:04.600
did you help your mother or your father

08:04.600 --> 08:05.880
with their work on the commune?

08:28.740 --> 08:32.200
No, because I had little children then,

08:32.420 --> 08:34.920
and so instead of helping them, I needed

08:34.920 --> 08:35.660
their help.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.760
How old were you when you had your first

08:40.760 --> 08:41.100
child?

09:03.800 --> 09:08.800
So we don't normally calculate our years

09:08.800 --> 09:11.480
and ages. So it was like, you know,

09:11.520 --> 09:14.100
animals giving birth. Likewise, we too

09:14.100 --> 09:18.440
gave birth to our children. Do your

09:18.440 --> 09:19.500
children live with you now?

09:26.940 --> 09:31.280
No, not together. I have three children,

09:31.400 --> 09:35.100
and I had my children in the hospital. Can

09:35.100 --> 09:37.620
you tell us about your experiences giving

09:37.620 --> 09:41.140
birth to children? So, Marwa, you are a

09:41.140 --> 09:43.760
very good teacher. You have taught us a

09:43.760 --> 09:47.180
lot of things. So, what do you think about

09:47.180 --> 09:50.840
teaching us how to be a good teacher? I

09:50.840 --> 09:53.820
don't know how to teach. I have been

09:53.820 --> 09:56.760
teaching since I was a child. I have been

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
teaching since I was a child. I don't know

09:58.760 --> 10:02.720
how to teach. I don't know how to teach. I

10:02.720 --> 10:04.660
don't know how to teach. I don't know how

10:04.660 --> 10:05.000
to teach.

10:14.620 --> 10:20.880
So I didn't give

10:20.880 --> 10:26.060
birth

10:26.060 --> 10:29.460
in hospitals and it was my husband that

10:29.460 --> 10:34.940
helped me during the childbirth. and it

10:34.940 --> 10:38.320
is only my daughter that was born in

10:38.320 --> 10:40.740
hospital and I couldn't give birth to her

10:40.740 --> 10:43.220
and all my other children including the

10:43.220 --> 10:47.660
twins were not born in hospital. How did

10:47.660 --> 10:48.740
your husband help you?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.940
I was a little girl, and I was a little

11:02.940 --> 11:07.000
girl. I was a little girl, and I was a

11:07.000 --> 11:10.140
little girl. I was a little girl, and I

11:10.140 --> 11:11.280
was a little girl. I was a little girl,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.540
and I was a little girl. I was a little

11:13.540 --> 11:17.380
girl, and I was a little girl. I was a

11:17.380 --> 11:20.680
little girl, and I was a little girl. I

11:20.680 --> 11:21.500
was a little girl, and I was a little

11:21.500 --> 11:21.780
girl.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.720
So when the first of the twins was born, I

11:44.720 --> 11:48.480
was on my knees and my husband, he took

11:48.480 --> 11:50.780
the child wrapped it in cloth and laid it

11:50.780 --> 11:54.220
on the bed and then I went out to answer

11:54.220 --> 11:57.140
nature's call and then I could feel that

11:57.140 --> 12:00.900
there was another child in me and so I

12:00.900 --> 12:03.800
told my husband that there is one more

12:03.800 --> 12:07.040
child and he said it can't be but then I

12:07.040 --> 12:09.420
said there is one more and then the other

12:09.420 --> 12:12.720
one was born and while breastfeeding I had

12:12.720 --> 12:15.440
to feed one child here and one child here

12:15.440 --> 12:17.900
and it was same when I was feeding them

12:17.900 --> 12:21.540
food later. At the same time, feeding them

12:21.540 --> 12:23.740
one here, one here? At the same time.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.020
Thujujjipa le chikla omadetje, chikla

12:26.020 --> 12:29.200
omadetje, roa? Nyaka tew. Nyaka ngode.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.620
Ngode nyaka sumte omadetje. Yes, because

12:32.620 --> 12:35.360
both cried at the same time. Cried, cried.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.760
And were all your children healthy when

12:38.760 --> 12:41.200
they were born? Amla, puku ketiw ka ne

12:41.200 --> 12:44.500
puku tsangma tangpo duwe? But it's my God.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.640
Like an angel that knew it as he certainly

12:46.640 --> 12:51.980
knew itala boy then that when he was

12:51.980 --> 12:54.340
praying for this is on the metal to

12:54.340 --> 12:59.060
install it at anytime once upon a sh onlar

12:59.060 --> 13:04.440
that an

13:04.440 --> 13:07.180
entire man carries it on hand. Does

13:15.660 --> 13:20.120
So the second of the twins was born leg

13:20.120 --> 13:23.300
first, and I thought it was a headless

13:23.300 --> 13:27.120
child. And then my husband pulled it out,

13:27.200 --> 13:30.220
and there was no crying, so I thought it

13:30.220 --> 13:32.620
wasn't alive. And when I touched the leg,

13:32.660 --> 13:35.100
it was warm, and then my husband cleaned

13:35.100 --> 13:39.840
it up. How did you feel? Can you remember

13:39.840 --> 13:40.680
your emotions?

14:37.180 --> 14:39.340
twins, you know, if one child got sick

14:39.340 --> 14:41.680
around 12 o'clock, the other would become

14:41.680 --> 14:45.520
sick at 3 p.m. So both had to be carried

14:45.520 --> 14:48.340
to the hospital in Pasa and it was very

14:48.340 --> 14:51.120
difficult. And then later my husband found

14:51.120 --> 14:55.020
work at a construction site and I could

14:55.020 --> 14:57.960
also find work but I couldn't do much as I

14:57.960 --> 15:01.600
was sick most of the time. So when you

15:01.600 --> 15:03.800
were sick, who took care of your children?

15:03.800 --> 15:03.880
one.

15:09.720 --> 15:23.280
There wasn't

15:23.280 --> 15:26.020
anyone else to take care of them. I had to

15:26.020 --> 15:27.660
and then when my husband been returned

15:27.660 --> 15:29.860
from work then we took care of them

15:29.860 --> 15:34.160
together so when you lived in Lhasa did

15:34.160 --> 15:38.520
you have family who also lived in Lhasa or

15:38.520 --> 15:39.380
lived near you

15:42.280 --> 15:45.280
I'm lucky that not me down pinga shambhala

15:45.280 --> 15:48.080
in the hustle a your a your mother no no

15:48.080 --> 15:52.960
both of us didn't have any relatives so

15:52.960 --> 15:58.600
you said that you went to Lhasa and you

15:58.600 --> 16:02.020
had three children what what made your

16:02.020 --> 16:03.240
family go to Lhasa?

16:44.580 --> 16:49.140
So we had to leave our hometown because we

16:49.140 --> 16:51.680
couldn't survive there. there, there was

16:51.680 --> 16:54.660
lack of food because if you couldn't work

16:54.660 --> 16:57.740
hard, there was no grains for you, and

16:57.740 --> 17:00.960
then since we had many children, both of

17:00.960 --> 17:04.200
us couldn't survive there and that's why

17:04.200 --> 17:06.680
my husband suggested that we go to Lhasa.

17:08.060 --> 17:12.460
Why wasn't there enough food? And Magali,

17:12.580 --> 17:16.960
how do you do the work? We do it by hand.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.140
We do it by hand. We do it by hand. We do

17:25.140 --> 17:27.620
it by hand. We do it by hand.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.860
So in the commune system, you know, if you

17:39.860 --> 17:44.220
could work, the officials gave you marks,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.940
and if you didn't, you know, there was no

17:46.940 --> 17:48.940
marks, which meant that you got no grains.

17:50.680 --> 17:56.360
But you worked, didn't you? Did you eat

17:56.360 --> 17:56.420
anything?

18:01.880 --> 18:02.920
We did,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.720
but there was nothing to eat, so we left.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.640
Was it because you had so many children

18:12.640 --> 18:14.560
that what you were allowed, what you were

18:14.560 --> 18:16.980
allocated wasn't enough? she cercs a

18:16.980 --> 18:19.920
Burgundy that is bigger than your body

18:19.920 --> 18:24.600
yes... she is heading towards the flour

18:24.600 --> 18:28.100
burgoodvy outfit she is taking a picture

18:28.100 --> 18:39.380
of it she would show us that we should

18:39.380 --> 18:44.280
remove

18:44.280 --> 18:44.340
the everywhere

18:47.980 --> 18:50.280
Yeah, the allocation wasn't sufficient.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.680
Right. And then when we were in Lhasa, a

18:53.680 --> 18:56.200
friend of my husband suggested that, you

18:56.200 --> 19:00.280
know, since we had many children, that if

19:00.280 --> 19:02.680
we went to Nepal, it would be a better

19:02.680 --> 19:05.040
life for the children. So that's why we

19:05.040 --> 19:10.920
came to Nepal. Right. Right. We'll come

19:10.920 --> 19:13.060
back to Nepal in a minute, but I was

19:13.060 --> 19:16.680
wondering, in what ways was life in Lhasa

19:16.680 --> 19:20.120
different from life in the village?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.380
The people of the village, they are very

19:40.380 --> 19:44.660
good at it. They are very good at it. They

19:44.660 --> 19:47.140
are very good at it. They are very good at

19:47.140 --> 19:51.140
it. They are very good at it. They are

19:51.140 --> 19:54.340
very good at it. They are very good at it.

19:55.180 --> 19:58.560
They are very good at it. They are very

19:58.560 --> 20:01.080
good at it. They are very good at it. They

20:01.080 --> 20:02.620
are very good at it. They are very good at

20:02.620 --> 20:05.200
it. They are very good at it.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.760
So it was

20:29.760 --> 20:33.100
better in Lhasa because my husband was

20:33.100 --> 20:36.300
engaged in the construction. work and then

20:36.300 --> 20:38.820
friends and other people they used to give

20:38.820 --> 20:42.760
us little bags of Sambal. Were there other

20:42.760 --> 20:44.400
ways in which your life in Lhasa was

20:44.400 --> 20:46.200
different from the village? You had more

20:46.200 --> 20:49.240
food but were there other ways in which

20:49.240 --> 20:50.260
your life was different?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.680
I don't know, I can't say.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.220
So I have only so much to say. Right. So

21:13.220 --> 21:17.800
your family decided to come to Nepal. Can

21:17.800 --> 21:20.900
you tell us the story of coming to Nepal?

21:47.000 --> 21:52.620
We wore it when we left for brazil Tinck

21:52.620 --> 21:58.260
Engine Rat We reuse it Handsome We walked

21:58.260 --> 22:08.500
towards here I went further Actually it' s

22:08.500 --> 22:10.700

22:12.820 --> 22:17.240
especially Erkeri. Theมואל push-psti'a and

22:17.240 --> 22:19.820
Donermasa and other people that the

22:19.820 --> 22:21.500
Pupawas are like my brothers сл Mate garat

22:21.500 --> 22:24.000
I must accompany them. If they're in

22:24.000 --> 22:25.340
progress I'll carry them to the front and

22:25.340 --> 22:27.480
bring them to the front and to be tough.

22:29.300 --> 22:32.180
They must find more ways. a very good farm

22:32.180 --> 22:41.700
and so it was split into two classes of

22:41.700 --> 22:45.920
Abutilsa,

22:46.680 --> 22:49.560
the old man and child and the son came

22:49.560 --> 22:49.880
from the government.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.760
So from Lhasa there were times when we

23:10.760 --> 23:14.360
were on foot and at times for an hour or

23:14.360 --> 23:17.060
two we We would ply by vehicles, but since

23:17.060 --> 23:20.340
we didn't have money to pay, we couldn't

23:20.340 --> 23:23.040
get vehicles right through. And it was

23:23.040 --> 23:26.680
from the border area of Tingri and Tamo

23:26.680 --> 23:30.440
that we came towards Nepal. And we were

23:30.440 --> 23:32.860
with quite a number of little children.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.620
And my husband was carrying one of the

23:36.620 --> 23:39.820
twins over his neck. And the oldest son

23:39.820 --> 23:42.320
was carrying one of the other twins. and

23:42.320 --> 23:47.020
the pathway was filled with snow and there

23:47.020 --> 23:49.420
were some Chinese people along the way

23:49.420 --> 23:51.840
that stopped us but since we were with

23:51.840 --> 23:54.460
little children they allowed us to go and

23:54.460 --> 23:56.900
in fact there were two girls that

23:56.900 --> 23:58.800
commented that the twins were very

23:58.800 --> 24:02.740
beautiful and then thanks to the grace of

24:02.740 --> 24:04.600
His Holiness we were able to escape

24:04.600 --> 24:09.360
safely. How long did it take you to come

24:09.360 --> 24:12.960
from Lhasa to Nepal? How long did it take

24:12.960 --> 24:14.580
to get to the mountain?

24:16.960 --> 24:20.500
It took about half a month. Half a month?

24:21.460 --> 24:25.880
Yes. We had to walk a lot. We had to walk

24:25.880 --> 24:32.300
a lot. We had to walk a lot. So it might

24:32.300 --> 24:35.140
have taken about half a month, because at

24:35.140 --> 24:37.320
times we were walking and at times we

24:37.320 --> 24:40.940
could get lift in some vehicles. So what

24:40.940 --> 24:43.500
did you take with you when you left Tibet?

25:20.040 --> 25:23.540
So we had brought nothing except our

25:23.540 --> 25:27.420
blankets and a little bit of Tsampa. And

25:27.420 --> 25:30.580
when we reached Nepal, my husband had

25:30.580 --> 25:33.300
friends to whom we sent message, and they

25:33.300 --> 25:36.120
came to fetch us at the reception

25:36.120 --> 25:40.700
committee office. And did you have enough

25:40.700 --> 25:43.860
food, enough sampa, for your whole family

25:43.860 --> 25:45.620
to go for these two weeks?

26:09.420 --> 26:13.800
There were so many kinesio timas over

26:13.800 --> 26:16.160
there on the번 지 산 полез Aoid guñ Guidá. I

26:16.160 --> 26:20.540

I was very young, I was very young, I was

27:06.600 --> 27:06.600
very

27:24.900 --> 27:29.420
So we had a little bit of sampa, and I

27:29.420 --> 27:31.840
used to feed the children in spoonfuls,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.760
which they used to gulp. and then we were

27:34.760 --> 27:38.260
able to cross over a mountain and there

27:38.260 --> 27:41.260
was a river and nearby we found some

27:41.260 --> 27:43.380
Nepalese police and we were really very

27:43.380 --> 27:47.880
scared and I told my husband, will they

27:47.880 --> 27:50.900
not kill us now? And then we met some

27:50.900 --> 27:53.580
merchants who said that now you need have

27:53.580 --> 27:56.400
no fear because you are in Nepalese

27:56.400 --> 27:59.580
territory and you will no longer fall into

27:59.580 --> 28:01.900
Chinese hands. But still they were very

28:01.900 --> 28:07.220
scared. And then we saw some Nepali road

28:07.220 --> 28:10.440
crew and they were living in little tents

28:10.440 --> 28:14.740
and so we entered one of the tents and

28:14.740 --> 28:17.700
they gave us hot water and I made little

28:17.700 --> 28:21.980
balls of dough with the Sampar and hot

28:21.980 --> 28:25.080
water and fed my children. And then we

28:25.080 --> 28:27.840
went to Dharamsala and we were very happy

28:27.840 --> 28:35.500
to see His So you arrived in Nepal and

28:35.500 --> 28:38.760
then how did you get to Dharamsala?

28:48.240 --> 28:53.080
The reception committee there dropped us

28:53.080 --> 28:57.740
to Dharamsala. I want to go back to make

28:57.740 --> 29:00.460
sure I've understood something. So your

29:00.460 --> 29:03.940
decision to leave Nepal, I mean to leave

29:03.940 --> 29:08.280
Tibet, was because of hunger? What was the

29:08.280 --> 29:10.400
reason why you left Tibet? Tibet.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.480
Oh, my Prophetïn University화� nickname was

29:42.480 --> 29:47.140
so amazing. We actually got to know about

29:47.140 --> 29:51.180
it since the early days, the time when we

29:51.180 --> 29:54.780
went as religious

29:55.880 --> 30:00.920
So you must be

30:00.920 --> 30:05.060
crazy. So the reason why we left our

30:05.060 --> 30:08.100
hometown for Lhasa was the lack of food

30:08.100 --> 30:12.460
and livelihood in Lhasa was better than in

30:12.460 --> 30:15.340
the hometown, but our children were not

30:15.340 --> 30:18.240
getting any education in Lhasa, so we were

30:18.240 --> 30:21.020
told that if we went to Nepal we would be

30:21.020 --> 30:23.580
able to admit our children into school, so

30:23.580 --> 30:25.800
for the sake of our children we left

30:25.800 --> 30:32.740
Tibet. Right. So you lived in Tibet when

30:32.740 --> 30:36.580
the Chinese were there. How was life like

30:36.580 --> 30:38.080
for you under the Chinese?

31:03.960 --> 31:07.840
I don't have much knowledge. That's

31:07.840 --> 31:11.840
between in the offices that happens and my

31:11.840 --> 31:16.120
job was just doing my work. And your work

31:16.120 --> 31:17.820
was what? What was your work?

31:40.180 --> 31:46.460
So our responsibility was harvesting the

31:46.460 --> 31:51.540
parni and then de-husking them in a large

31:51.540 --> 31:55.300
open ground during the commune, but I have

31:55.300 --> 31:58.280
forgotten much of it. What about in Lhasa?

31:58.440 --> 32:01.240
What was your work in Lhasa? So, how did

32:01.240 --> 32:05.360
you get to know about Lhasa? I learned

32:05.360 --> 32:08.120
about Lhasa from my father. He taught me

32:08.120 --> 32:10.260
how to make a pot, and how to make a pot.

32:12.620 --> 32:16.180
I learned how to make a pot.

32:19.780 --> 32:21.780
Lhasa is a pot, and I learned how to make

32:21.780 --> 32:27.700
a pot. up, . That's like what I told you

32:27.700 --> 32:30.580
earlier, constructing houses, digging the

32:30.580 --> 32:33.560
ground, laying the bricks, and building as

32:33.560 --> 32:41.200
it happens here. You did that. . . . . . .

32:41.200 --> 32:46.620
. . . . . . . . No, I couldn't go to work

32:46.620 --> 32:52.480
because I was sick. Right, okay. Did you

32:52.480 --> 32:55.780
have any interactions with Chinese people?

32:57.360 --> 33:01.680
No. So did life change for you when the

33:01.680 --> 33:09.440
Chinese came to you? No. Did life

33:09.440 --> 33:14.600
change for you when the Chinese came to

33:14.600 --> 33:14.960
Tibet?

33:41.700 --> 33:49.000
Yes, in 1961-62, by then the Chinese had

33:49.000 --> 33:51.900
already launched the liberation. And at

33:51.900 --> 33:54.180
that time, when my husband and I escaped,

33:55.200 --> 33:59.580
there wasn't many people escaping then,

33:59.760 --> 34:02.520
but later on, more and more people started

34:02.520 --> 34:06.540
coming. And what happened then?

34:37.280 --> 34:40.080
Once we were at the reception center here

34:40.080 --> 34:42.900
and then we were sent to see His Holiness

34:42.900 --> 34:45.360
the Dalai Lama in the Ramsala and then the

34:45.360 --> 34:47.640
children were put in school and then my

34:47.640 --> 34:50.420
husband and I, we were sent to a factory

34:50.420 --> 34:53.740
in Dalahousey in Himachal Pradesh and then

34:53.740 --> 34:56.460
there was no problem at all. Was your

34:56.460 --> 34:59.000
husband affected at all by the Chinese

34:59.000 --> 34:59.440
occupation?

35:29.440 --> 35:38.280
That's why I'm saying that he

35:38.280 --> 35:40.740
was a construction worker. He was a

35:40.740 --> 35:44.400
construction worker in Pasta. He was

35:44.400 --> 35:49.220
laying the iron rods for the construction.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.860
After coming into India, he worked as an

35:53.860 --> 35:59.740
embosser of handmade carpets. Right at the

35:59.740 --> 36:02.840
beginning you mentioned that most of your

36:02.840 --> 36:05.900
children except for your last child were

36:05.900 --> 36:09.060
born at home. But one child was born in

36:09.060 --> 36:12.200
the hospital. Why was that child born in

36:12.200 --> 36:15.040
the hospital? What caused you to go to the

36:15.040 --> 36:15.960
hospital for that birth?

36:39.520 --> 36:43.960
So I was having labor pains but could not

36:43.960 --> 36:46.420
give birth. So that's why I went to the

36:46.420 --> 36:52.380
hospital. And your baby was safe? Yes, my

36:52.380 --> 36:55.040
baby was safe. I was able to go to the

36:55.040 --> 36:57.360
hospital and I was able to go to the

36:57.360 --> 36:57.800
hospital.

37:01.100 --> 37:05.280
I was able to go to the hospital and I was

37:05.280 --> 37:13.820
able to go to the hospital.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.380
Yes, the last child was born in hospital

37:38.380 --> 37:42.460
after five or six days. actually the labor

37:42.460 --> 37:45.420
pains had started and the child wasn't

37:45.420 --> 37:48.440
born so the nurse told me that I would

37:48.440 --> 37:50.420
have to stay in hospital for a few days

37:50.420 --> 37:53.020
because it was a big child but I didn't

37:53.020 --> 37:55.600
want to stay and wanted to go back home

37:55.600 --> 37:59.100
and my husband said that you know I

37:59.100 --> 38:01.560
wouldn't take me home saying that you know

38:01.560 --> 38:04.200
if we went back home that child and I

38:04.200 --> 38:08.900
would die. Is there anything else that you

38:08.900 --> 38:10.640
would like to share with us about your

38:10.640 --> 38:15.180
life in Tibet? . .

38:18.060 --> 38:19.160
That's about it.

38:22.260 --> 38:27.580
Thank you. If this interview were shown in

38:27.580 --> 38:30.320
Tibet or China, would it be a problem for

38:30.320 --> 38:31.640
you? .

38:42.740 --> 38:48.700
I don't know

38:48.700 --> 38:51.400
whether there will be any problems or no

38:51.400 --> 38:54.220
problems. Is it okay if we use your real

38:54.220 --> 38:58.460
name? I think that's a good thing. I think

38:58.460 --> 39:00.980
that's a good thing. I think that's a good

39:00.980 --> 39:05.380
thing. Yes, it is. If I had a child, I

39:05.380 --> 39:10.700
would have a child. Yes, but then if the

39:10.700 --> 39:12.700
Chinese come and investigate, they may

39:12.700 --> 39:16.080
take me away. Thank you very much for

39:16.080 --> 39:17.500
sharing your story with us.
