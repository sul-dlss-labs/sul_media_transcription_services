original jamboree.

so well.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.380
I was saying good evening, ladies and

12:37.380 --> 12:40.440
gentlemen. This is a bilingual situation

12:40.440 --> 12:46.940
here. And it's more than bilingual because

12:46.940 --> 12:51.580
Patato speaks Spanish, English, African.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.960
Muchacho. I'm talking about Mr. Carlos

there they didn't have room to put, or

13:13.680 --> 13:15.740
they didn't have the letters. They put

13:15.740 --> 13:18.060
just my name. They're supposed to be my

13:18.060 --> 13:20.740
name and the Inter-American band with

13:20.740 --> 13:24.240
Nicky Marrero. How about that?
