00:02.560 --> 00:03.780
Tanya Cushman Reviewer's Tanya Cushman

00:03.780 --> 00:06.040
Reviewer's Tanya Cushman ...tonight and

00:06.040 --> 00:07.800
that's the opening. The opening is for me

00:07.800 --> 00:09.940
saying I'm the person who normally

00:09.940 --> 00:13.200
introduces the speaker, who introduces the

00:13.200 --> 00:16.660
evening speaker. But tonight we really

00:16.660 --> 00:19.300
have no speaker. So the first thing I

00:19.300 --> 00:21.820
wanted to ask you is to help me welcome

00:21.820 --> 00:24.180
Mrs. Pina Bausch and the dancers.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.700
Now, as you imagine, although my friend

00:48.700 --> 00:50.100
Jeffrey Schnapp is standing here, I'm

00:50.100 --> 00:51.540
standing here, we are not going to do the

00:51.540 --> 00:56.680
performance tonight. Maybe next time. So

00:56.680 --> 00:58.480
Matthias Schmigel from the Tanztheater

00:58.480 --> 01:00.840
will introduce the dancers of the

01:00.840 --> 01:03.700
Tanztheater to you. Good evening, thank

01:03.700 --> 01:06.340
you very much. First I will start with

01:06.340 --> 01:08.240
Julie Shanahan from Australia.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.360
Juliana Arante from Brazil.

01:23.920 --> 01:32.100
Rafael Delonay from France, Fernando

01:32.100 --> 01:38.660
Suell from Venezuela, and

01:38.660 --> 01:40.540
the one in charge of our our music,

01:40.760 --> 01:42.240
Matthias Burckert from Germany.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.180
See, now you know that part of the reason

01:49.180 --> 01:50.880
to organize tonight's event was to show

01:50.880 --> 01:53.220
you what a multicultural country Germany

01:53.220 --> 01:55.960
is, especially Wuppertal. This is truly

01:55.960 --> 02:00.400
amazing. Talking of which, this is a very

02:00.400 --> 02:03.420
special event also to give thank you to

02:03.420 --> 02:05.680
President Kasper, not only for his

02:05.680 --> 02:07.360
continued support, now that we enter the

02:07.360 --> 02:10.080
final stretch of the early round of the

02:10.080 --> 02:12.800
Presidential Lectures and Symposia. I need

02:12.800 --> 02:15.140
to say tonight that, Pina, I think that's

02:15.140 --> 02:17.300
true. We wouldn't have gotten you without

02:17.300 --> 02:19.480
Gerhard's intervention. And there's a

02:19.480 --> 02:22.080
secret, because President Kasper and Pina

02:22.080 --> 02:24.300
Bausch are both members of the highest

02:24.300 --> 02:26.040
order, one of the highest orders of the

02:26.040 --> 02:28.060
Federal Republic of Germany, the Puhle

02:28.060 --> 02:30.120
Merit. So this is for the two Puhle Merit

02:30.120 --> 02:30.820
prize-takers.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.860
And I wouldn't want to miss the

02:39.860 --> 02:41.640
opportunity to briefly, briefly announce

02:41.640 --> 02:45.200
our other events of this artsy program in

02:45.200 --> 02:48.480
the fall of this academic year. Our next

02:48.480 --> 02:50.180
event will be a colloquium, humanities,

02:50.420 --> 02:53.600
social sciences, and law on the topic past

02:53.600 --> 02:55.560
dependencies and that will take place in

02:55.560 --> 02:58.080
the law school on November 5th, Friday,

02:58.260 --> 03:01.280
and November November 6th, a Saturday, and

03:01.280 --> 03:02.860
there will be, because this is the Artsy

03:02.860 --> 03:05.800
Fall, a piano recital by Charles Rosen on

03:05.800 --> 03:08.620
the evening of Friday. The following event

03:08.620 --> 03:10.480
is just the following Monday, November

03:10.480 --> 03:13.240
8th. This will be a lecture in our lecture

03:13.240 --> 03:15.080
series of the art historian Svetlana

03:15.080 --> 03:19.660
Alpers. And finally, on November 29th,

03:19.660 --> 03:22.020
again a Monday, in Kresge Auditorium,

03:22.020 --> 03:24.660
we'll have a bilingual poetry reading by

03:24.660 --> 03:28.660
the great Chinese poet Bei Dao and by his

03:28.660 --> 03:31.140
translator and friend Elliot Weinberger.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.380
So we'll have poems in Mandarin and poems

03:33.380 --> 03:35.780
in English and the next day as always

03:35.780 --> 03:38.840
there will be ample opportunity for

03:38.840 --> 03:43.800
discussion. Now I was saying that I was

03:43.800 --> 03:45.840
not introducing a person who's introducing

03:45.840 --> 03:48.900
Pina Bausch because so many people we know

03:48.900 --> 03:50.700
it from the hits counted have seen the

03:50.700 --> 03:52.940
website but I would like to inform you

03:52.940 --> 03:55.720
briefly what we have planned tonight. In a

03:55.720 --> 03:57.280
minute, in literally a minute, Pina Bausch

03:57.280 --> 03:59.760
will take over and lead you into the dance

03:59.760 --> 04:01.540
rehearsal. And the very exciting thing for

04:01.540 --> 04:03.000
us is we have no clue what's going to

04:03.000 --> 04:06.140
happen. It's going to be great, no doubt

04:06.140 --> 04:09.220
about it. After an hour or so, Pina Bausch

04:09.220 --> 04:11.820
will ask my colleague and friend Jeffrey

04:11.820 --> 04:13.980
Schnap, the Rossetti Professor of Italian

04:13.980 --> 04:15.720
Literature and Comparative Literature,

04:15.740 --> 04:17.120
that's not the official title but I want

04:17.120 --> 04:20.840
to say it's complete too, and he will then

04:20.840 --> 04:22.700
have a discussion, conduct a discussion

04:22.700 --> 04:25.480
with Pina and with the dancers and we will

04:25.480 --> 04:29.420
soon open up to the floor. And then at 9 o

04:29.420 --> 04:32.260
'clock sharp, more or less sharp, we will

04:32.260 --> 04:34.280
have on behalf of President Kasper a

04:34.280 --> 04:36.220
reception here in the courtyard of Roble

04:36.220 --> 04:39.280
and that is definitely a reception for

04:39.280 --> 04:41.820
everybody. So we really have to help us to

04:41.820 --> 04:44.680
eliminate, to delete all the food which

04:44.680 --> 04:47.260
will be out there at 9 o'clock. So thanks

04:47.260 --> 04:49.160
again for coming and Pina we are so much

04:49.160 --> 04:49.620
looking forward.

05:02.640 --> 05:09.740
Oh yes. Good evening. I'm very very happy

05:09.740 --> 05:15.280
and honored to be here at Stanford and I

05:15.280 --> 05:17.360
like to thank very much for this wonderful

05:17.360 --> 05:17.860
invitation.

05:21.370 --> 05:23.560
For me it's very difficult because usually

05:24.520 --> 05:27.360
I have not much work because what I have

05:27.360 --> 05:30.160
to say I usually try to do with my works

05:30.160 --> 05:36.180
on the stage. And so it was not possible

05:36.180 --> 05:38.620
to do here performance because we are on

05:38.620 --> 05:40.400
tour, we are in the moment in Berkeley.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.160
And then I thought maybe it would be very

05:44.160 --> 05:50.480
nice to just show a bit of the work. And I

05:50.480 --> 05:56.380
thought about the Rite of Spring from Igor

05:56.380 --> 05:56.940
Stravinsky.

06:00.220 --> 06:06.120
This is the part of the chosen one, the

06:06.120 --> 06:11.620
end of this work. and it's a chosen one,

06:11.740 --> 06:16.780
so it's the girl who has to dance till she

06:16.780 --> 06:22.320
dies, actually. So, we are not prepared at

06:22.320 --> 06:27.460
all. It's really something we didn't... I

06:27.460 --> 06:30.220
told them yesterday, kind of, what we're

06:30.220 --> 06:35.460
going to do. and Ruthie, she did it

06:35.460 --> 06:39.060
actually many times in the choreography.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.460
Rafaela has learned it two, three years

06:42.460 --> 06:45.060
ago, but she never danced it. Julie

06:45.060 --> 06:47.580
touched it once a little bit. And

06:47.580 --> 06:50.920
Fernando, I also like to do it. Usually

06:50.920 --> 06:54.860
it's a woman who is doing that. He never

06:54.860 --> 06:58.720
did it, but they always see it. they see

06:58.720 --> 07:00.780
it many times because usually when this

07:00.780 --> 07:04.600
dance happens the other people are all

07:04.600 --> 07:07.660
there, they watch how that happens. So I

07:07.660 --> 07:11.380
thought maybe I want to do something too,

07:11.480 --> 07:14.400
I thought maybe it's nice to do a little

07:14.400 --> 07:16.740
work with them and that's why they are not

07:16.740 --> 07:18.500
prepared otherwise I have nothing to do.

07:20.520 --> 07:25.340
But to have just a little bit the idea of

07:25.340 --> 07:28.460
it Maybe it's a little bit difficult for

07:28.460 --> 07:31.580
Ruchi, but maybe the best is once like

07:31.580 --> 07:36.800
easily, because it's hard. Maybe she can

07:36.800 --> 07:39.140
show once a dance, and then we do piece by

07:39.140 --> 07:40.580
piece, work a little bit on it.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.920


08:54.080 --> 08:55.480


09:24.080 --> 09:25.480


09:54.080 --> 09:55.480


10:24.080 --> 10:25.480


10:54.080 --> 10:55.480


11:24.080 --> 11:25.480


11:54.040 --> 11:55.440
¶¶

12:23.680 --> 12:25.080
¶¶

12:53.220 --> 12:54.080
¶¶

13:17.040 --> 13:19.700
Usually it's, of course, without

13:19.700 --> 13:23.000
preparation and without the peace when

13:23.000 --> 13:24.760
that happened, it's also it's a little

13:24.760 --> 13:28.780
complicated and usually the it's a yeah

13:28.780 --> 13:31.340
it's about the earth about the spring and

13:31.340 --> 13:33.220
usually when they dance it it's in the

13:33.220 --> 13:35.320
earth and when they fall it's the whole

13:35.320 --> 13:37.120
thing is very different because you never

13:37.120 --> 13:39.780
have a floor like this the dancing and the

13:39.780 --> 13:44.460
earth so that's very different thank you

13:44.460 --> 13:48.840
so okay

13:48.840 --> 13:53.700
Okay, we start a little bit. You must just

13:53.700 --> 13:54.500
a little bit help.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.480
We take the first bit, a little marking.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.320
You remember the...

14:09.540 --> 14:11.960
They all go away. Please come here.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.480
I don't want to dance, you should dance.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.060
You know the movement, you know this one,

14:24.080 --> 14:25.720
because many things in the choreography,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.720
they are also in different ways, different

14:27.720 --> 14:29.820
combinations, so it's not so new, the

14:29.820 --> 14:32.800
step. You have this one, only without

14:32.800 --> 14:36.720
the... And this, and this with head down.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.480
And then the weight, and we go back. And

14:40.480 --> 14:42.080
again.

14:44.240 --> 14:50.340
And with looking. And go back again. And

14:50.340 --> 14:52.940
you have heard me wrote this.

14:54.620 --> 14:58.160
The third time. The third time, only till

14:58.160 --> 15:01.280
here. Yeah, only till here. Here, then

15:01.280 --> 15:09.400
here, here, down,

15:10.200 --> 15:21.180
down, down, up, down, down, up. And, oh,

15:21.280 --> 15:27.760
I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry, yeah. One

15:27.760 --> 15:31.900
more time. And this.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.760
One more. And like you're getting yourself

15:39.760 --> 15:41.120
and then up.

15:46.840 --> 15:50.300
Changing direction. One more.

15:54.680 --> 16:04.080
Not much. Okay. Okay. Okay, yeah. Oh, it's

16:04.080 --> 16:09.600
down, the accent is always . The accent is

16:09.600 --> 16:13.140
down. And right away.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.260
With looking.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.100
Third time. Okay.

16:30.060 --> 16:39.700
And up and again this one, like this.

16:46.860 --> 16:53.980
It's like so. You go here and then you

16:53.980 --> 16:56.980
take it from here, you squeeze, you take

16:56.980 --> 16:59.400
it out here like this. Out and it's like

16:59.400 --> 17:03.040
you hit. No, no. You take it out and it's

17:03.040 --> 17:07.340
like you're hitting yourself. and then and

17:07.340 --> 17:11.860
then and then and then and then and then

17:12.920 --> 17:15.800
and then and then back and then change

17:19.440 --> 17:22.180
maybe we mark it a few times and we just

17:22.180 --> 17:25.560
hear it with the music just marking yeah

17:25.560 --> 17:25.960
Matthias?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.900
without the fall without the fall in the

17:31.900 --> 17:32.140
beginning

18:04.180 --> 18:04.400
Not much yet.

18:08.520 --> 18:13.000
Just that you know with the music. Easy.

18:14.080 --> 18:14.900
Not too much.

18:41.460 --> 18:44.680
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

19:04.980 --> 19:09.400
da da, and you have this arm, this arm,

19:09.560 --> 19:15.940
and you put together, so, round together,

19:17.160 --> 19:21.980
oh, microphone, and like a curve, like a

19:21.980 --> 19:26.040
curve back. Can you show it again please?

19:32.060 --> 19:35.940
Just a little bit. Just that. Yeah.

19:46.780 --> 19:50.160
This like a circle. Like make a circle.

19:55.540 --> 19:56.020
Yeah.

20:01.880 --> 20:07.240
Okay. And then from here, you have with

20:07.240 --> 20:09.280
the leg, I do it without the leg. You have

20:09.280 --> 20:14.300
this arm. From here, you go here with the

20:14.300 --> 20:19.040
leg. Up, up. And it's like, oops, it's my

20:19.040 --> 20:25.180
microphone. Here. So over here, like to

20:25.180 --> 20:27.980
cover yourself. And then it's like, yeah,

20:28.080 --> 20:32.100
da, da, yeah. Da, da, yeah. Da, da, and

20:32.100 --> 20:34.100
then you have the music when you have some

20:34.100 --> 20:41.560
music. Again, da, da, hum, hum. Yeah. So,

20:41.700 --> 20:42.120
again.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.580
In the music you have to hear it. It's

21:15.580 --> 21:19.500
over the music. There's a certain sound

21:19.500 --> 21:23.440
you do. Up, down, down, down, up, arm.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.360
Again.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.540
Wait, let's do it again. Do it again

21:37.540 --> 21:41.660
without. Yes, that's just small, there's

21:41.660 --> 21:44.180
little time. It's small, yes.

21:47.260 --> 21:48.840
Yes, with the head, head.

21:57.260 --> 22:00.100
That's one passé, yes. Not too diagonally,

22:00.120 --> 22:04.520
a little flatter. A little flatter.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.620
Up. Like somebody takes you here on the

22:11.620 --> 22:17.160
wrist. And that is like quick. No, not

22:17.160 --> 22:19.820
looking up, but looking. Yes, like you

22:19.820 --> 22:21.980
cover yourself, you protect yourself, yes.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.740
And then you go in all directions, like

22:24.740 --> 22:28.540
fighting, like this. And then using this

22:28.540 --> 22:31.980
like up, down. Down, down, up, up.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.340
Maybe we mark it from the beginning,

22:43.540 --> 22:46.020
including this. Okay.

23:27.880 --> 23:32.840
It wouldn't be nice if you那 would not sn

23:32.840 --> 23:36.360
entsprech

23:36.360 --> 23:40.500
That's an extra before you actually start

23:40.500 --> 23:44.740
running. Down, down, up, like a little

23:44.740 --> 23:48.820
jump, straight legs. Down, down.

23:55.340 --> 24:01.080
Have you realized the music? This... After

24:01.080 --> 24:01.400
that...

24:10.520 --> 24:15.380
Up, down, down, down, up, up.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.140
Without putting the hand extra, don't have

24:24.140 --> 24:30.860
it here. So you are, you just

24:30.860 --> 24:33.120
are up, down. That's more like squeezing

24:33.120 --> 24:35.440
in, it's like the knees, you know, here.

24:35.440 --> 24:40.080
So it's like, it's not like so, but

24:40.080 --> 24:44.220
together. Like that. Just up. And then

24:44.220 --> 24:44.720
like that.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.360
You know, here. here, here, here. So

25:04.360 --> 25:07.560
actually this is looking out, far. This is

25:07.560 --> 25:09.780
up, and that's down.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.760
Third. Yeah, you are here, and then it's

25:23.760 --> 25:26.820
like a jump. Yeah, yeah.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.540
down,

25:33.320 --> 25:41.260
down, and then down, down, down, down.

25:43.900 --> 25:44.520
Yeah.

25:50.570 --> 25:53.920
We continue a little bit, continue a

25:53.920 --> 25:56.200
little bit. So the other one with the

25:56.200 --> 25:59.580
music you know. So you're here, you wait,

25:59.720 --> 26:01.680
and then when this music comes, it's like

26:01.680 --> 26:04.700
you're in so big tension, and it's like,

26:04.780 --> 26:09.300
it's like a shock. It has no shape. It has

26:09.300 --> 26:12.540
a, it's this, you listen, you don't know

26:12.540 --> 26:14.360
where to go. It's just like a reaction.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.380
The second one is running so fast as

26:17.380 --> 26:19.500
possible, like you want to escape, but you

26:19.500 --> 26:24.640
can't. you're running here and the third

26:24.640 --> 26:27.240
one is like we stolper

26:28.840 --> 26:32.000
like around yourself and then you continue

26:32.000 --> 26:38.980
yes it has no no special and then you it's

26:38.980 --> 26:41.940
like somebody is behind you a little bit

26:41.940 --> 26:47.800
like so Fernando that way a little bit

26:54.860 --> 26:57.800
And then sometimes quicker, sometimes

26:57.800 --> 27:03.260
faster. Yeah, until the new movement comes

27:03.260 --> 27:04.160
again. This one.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.480
And then just the weight let go. go down

27:12.480 --> 27:36.020
when

27:36.020 --> 27:38.160
you're down it's already like the

27:38.160 --> 27:41.760
preparation to like you You stretch knees,

27:41.980 --> 27:44.620
yes. Yes, and the arms are here.

27:48.380 --> 27:52.540
Then from here, you turn and you do a

27:52.540 --> 27:58.860
rond. The hands go here on your legs, yes.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.040
You have a rond to the floor. The floor.

28:04.760 --> 28:09.660
Turn here, in, and now Now, through the

28:09.660 --> 28:13.160
hip, up, and you go into this movement,

28:13.260 --> 28:18.400
yes. From here, you go into this movement.

28:20.620 --> 28:25.360
This is this. Yeah, we know this one here.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.540
This one.

28:29.900 --> 28:33.460
And then this one. One or two.

28:39.020 --> 28:42.880
And here you wave, here you wave. And you

28:42.880 --> 28:53.600
have, da, da, da. Oop. Da, da, da. Da, da,

28:53.700 --> 28:56.560
da. Da, da.

28:59.700 --> 29:07.940
Da, da, da. attitude for look run again

29:07.940 --> 29:11.640
stop slowly

29:11.640 --> 29:21.620
slowly from where from where I am so

29:21.620 --> 29:23.460
that's clear from here what could be clear

29:23.460 --> 29:25.420
is this one it's a little diagonal

29:26.360 --> 29:27.220
Running.

29:33.380 --> 29:39.420
Walking around. And now you have a up,

29:39.460 --> 29:48.380
down, step, step, down, down. Take it

29:48.380 --> 29:48.680
easy.

29:54.100 --> 30:01.960
Turn here, continue into this and go on

30:01.960 --> 30:13.180
into this and continue. you. Here wait and

30:13.180 --> 30:13.540
then.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.360
Oh, sorry.

30:23.640 --> 30:28.440
From here, from here, when you are, from

30:28.440 --> 30:28.740
here.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.560
You have You have this and you're over

30:33.560 --> 30:33.720
here.

30:39.700 --> 30:43.720
Actually, I'm afraid to hit my chest here.

30:45.100 --> 30:49.860
And then, like you cut. Yeah. Bam, bam,

30:49.860 --> 30:50.440
bam.

30:52.960 --> 31:01.500
Bam, bam, bam. Bam, bam. Yeah. Arm, arm.

31:03.160 --> 31:12.360
Arm. Yeah. Yum, bam, bam. I did it. Fall,

31:12.360 --> 31:16.240
look, run. It's a real fall. It's a real

31:16.240 --> 31:21.120
fall, but that's a. They have to mark this

31:21.120 --> 31:26.880
as little. Maybe we can try once from here

31:26.880 --> 31:29.120
with the music to mark a little bit where

31:29.120 --> 31:29.780
the music is.

32:15.740 --> 32:17.140


32:40.940 --> 32:43.820
Okay, okay. Take it a bit more easy. It's

32:43.820 --> 32:46.180
easy, it's a, it's,

32:47.940 --> 32:51.820
Gucci line, it's right as my easy, just

32:51.820 --> 32:53.100
with the music, you know?

32:59.680 --> 33:02.100
Just for the music, just marking, yeah?

33:02.220 --> 33:04.900
Just marking. Julie, did you hear Rafaela?

33:06.240 --> 33:08.300
Marking, just like a, okay.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.720


34:12.320 --> 34:14.440
 Okay.

34:20.380 --> 34:25.240
How long it takes to? You have to hear the

34:25.240 --> 34:29.200
music. Yeah, yeah. So okay, the next bit

34:29.200 --> 34:32.500
you have this with the head. You just try

34:32.500 --> 34:35.680
to follow the rhythm of the looking,

34:35.800 --> 34:38.820
hearing, you know, just this little head

34:38.820 --> 34:41.580
movement with the music. and from here

34:41.580 --> 34:43.540
it's like your weight you you leave your

34:43.540 --> 34:46.580
weight and you just like go in this

34:46.580 --> 34:50.960
direction yeah it's not high point it's

34:50.960 --> 34:56.380
not it's just like this and from here

34:56.380 --> 34:59.360
comes yes this one

35:07.380 --> 35:09.480
And again into this one.

35:12.960 --> 35:17.280
And then you have this with the raw.

35:20.200 --> 35:25.520
Over and stretching, turn and always

35:25.520 --> 35:28.320
ending profile. and the after profile

35:28.320 --> 35:31.860
ending after the turn profile yes to

35:31.860 --> 35:33.620
ending here and then from here you start

35:33.620 --> 35:36.500
again again into the attitude

35:41.260 --> 35:43.440
and turn it forget yes

35:50.360 --> 35:53.140
okay this you have three times i think i

35:53.140 --> 36:06.540
think

36:06.540 --> 36:09.900
it goes up and then it's from here You go

36:09.900 --> 36:15.900
down like this, yes. Huh? You go like

36:15.900 --> 36:18.320
this, but then when you turn, yeah, you

36:18.320 --> 36:20.380
just forget you go, you go, you think on

36:20.380 --> 36:21.200
the next one, yes.

36:26.840 --> 36:29.100
And this one is always like with a little

36:29.100 --> 36:33.020
bit, it's

36:33.020 --> 36:35.440
not, not so low, it's higher here with the

36:35.440 --> 36:38.780
lift. It's like you're pushing, yes.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.580
Fighting it, yes. Till it's straight.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.400
That's the arm stretch. And then, actually

36:46.400 --> 36:49.820
now there is just a stop. There is certain

36:49.820 --> 36:53.780
music is about three times. Yeah, it's a

36:53.780 --> 36:55.980
kind of stop. And then actually the

36:55.980 --> 36:58.680
beginning comes again. You repeat the

36:58.680 --> 37:05.300
beginning. beginning, looking,

37:07.260 --> 37:20.900
and

37:20.900 --> 37:27.060
then from

37:27.060 --> 37:29.600
here it's like, make the whole the whole

37:29.600 --> 37:30.080
circle.

37:32.900 --> 37:36.900
Also certain music. We have

37:40.530 --> 37:46.640
this movement, just this. Oh, yes.

37:49.610 --> 37:56.540
Until here. So, where do we go from where?

38:02.940 --> 38:07.520
After the looking, just to think again

38:07.520 --> 38:10.500
what it was, so you have before you had

38:10.500 --> 38:14.260
done, you remember? After the looking

38:14.260 --> 38:18.700
comes this, yeah. So first you are here,

38:18.760 --> 38:20.520
you have the looking, and then from here

38:20.520 --> 38:24.160
you go in this direction. Now comes this

38:24.160 --> 38:24.520
movement.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.900
This goes into the attitude.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.160
Profile.

38:40.200 --> 38:48.860
And then comes

38:48.860 --> 38:50.740
the beginning again. Well, that's clear.

38:50.860 --> 38:54.180
The beginning is clear. Yeah, only you can

38:54.180 --> 38:58.680
take even more space. Yes. But then it

38:58.680 --> 39:02.360
says the whole beginning except the end is

39:02.360 --> 39:06.100
after the running around that you have to

39:06.100 --> 39:07.160
have a cue for this.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.760
This and this.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.760
Okay, let's have this with music maybe

39:17.760 --> 39:18.760
from the...

39:23.360 --> 39:24.560
Maybe a little bit here, please.

39:29.640 --> 39:34.920
Ah, from here. You walk here and then it's

39:34.920 --> 39:37.280
just like this. Just like direct.

39:40.540 --> 39:43.580
This is, yes, you have to go like right

39:43.580 --> 39:45.300
away into it because there's not so much

39:45.300 --> 39:45.600
time.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.640
You have to already, when you turn, you

39:50.640 --> 39:52.200
have to start with your arms.

39:54.980 --> 39:57.040
Yeah. It's too late. You have to be

39:57.040 --> 39:58.500
quicker here.

40:01.240 --> 40:06.560
Anyway, this movement, wait, wait. You're

40:06.560 --> 40:11.980
here, you're here, one line

40:11.980 --> 40:15.300
on the shoulder. This still tries to stay

40:15.300 --> 40:17.180
diagonal. Actually the leg is more front,

40:17.320 --> 40:20.300
Rafaela. Yes, I think it's more like an

40:20.300 --> 40:22.100
opposite direction. And then you go back

40:22.100 --> 40:25.540
to the standing leg. But this is here.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.080
Yeah, the whole body is, you stay here,

40:30.240 --> 40:33.440
here, here. So, this shoulder is a little

40:33.440 --> 40:37.760
deeper. This one here. And then the hip

40:37.760 --> 40:40.840
pulls you front, but the body back. So

40:40.840 --> 40:43.440
very far backwards, yes, like that. And

40:43.440 --> 40:45.600
then go and right away the arm turn.

40:46.180 --> 40:48.280
Better, yes. Yeah.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.640
Let's go straight down.

41:05.060 --> 41:09.080
Up, and now you go straight. Straight

41:09.080 --> 41:14.040
down. Straight and straight. No, you

41:14.040 --> 41:19.360
don't... Yes, there. And then you... Down.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.580
It goes lower, a little bit lower. When

41:24.580 --> 41:26.780
this arm comes, it goes a bit lower.

41:31.660 --> 41:36.340
and push through and turn

41:39.440 --> 41:48.280
okay yeah okay we hear

41:48.280 --> 41:50.720
this with music Maybe we'll start with

41:50.720 --> 41:51.760
these little heads.

42:30.920 --> 42:33.300
Easy. No, no, no, easy.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.640
You are able to continue? Is it brighter?

43:15.480 --> 43:18.960
The timing of the... We can do it again.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.200
Just mark it, of course. Don't do it too

43:21.200 --> 43:21.380
much.

43:26.100 --> 43:30.100
When you start too late, you never... it's

43:30.100 --> 43:34.160
impossible to... Just easy. Maybe the same

43:34.160 --> 43:36.980
spot. maybe a little tiny little bit

43:36.980 --> 43:39.400
before we can do this accents here, so

43:39.400 --> 43:39.940
with the running.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.060
Oh, gee.

44:58.840 --> 45:01.640
I think you're very good. Huh?

45:04.760 --> 45:08.040
Yeah, it's just the weight brings you a

45:08.040 --> 45:10.640
little bit. Actually it moves a little

45:10.640 --> 45:14.500
bit, yes. Wait a minute, so now we are

45:14.500 --> 45:18.780
here. Now you have a, you touch your hand

45:18.780 --> 45:22.740
here. Touch it, you have your,

45:24.520 --> 45:27.660
like you're going this around, so this

45:27.660 --> 45:35.420
makes you move. So this, up, up, up, and.

45:55.020 --> 45:57.460
And sometimes leave it together, so it's

45:57.460 --> 46:03.280
not all the same. So you have to move so

46:03.280 --> 46:05.660
far with the arm that his foot has to

46:05.660 --> 46:09.480
move. You have to move. And also this

46:09.480 --> 46:12.580
brings it back. So it happens, this

46:12.580 --> 46:15.340
movement in the foot. And sometimes you

46:15.340 --> 46:18.820
leave it even. Sometimes you're only going

46:18.820 --> 46:24.540
like this, and then you open it again. And

46:24.540 --> 46:28.200
then open it. and slow ones and very fast

46:28.200 --> 46:30.500
ones very fat up but always up reaching

46:30.500 --> 46:33.440
reaching always I in the app is reaching

46:33.440 --> 46:41.580
is important up always up Up. Up. Rafa.

46:44.680 --> 46:48.500
Why don't we all go more front? Sorry.

46:51.020 --> 46:52.080
Come, talk a bit.
