WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:03.000
.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.740
My name is Elvira Prieto. I'm a sophomore

00:26.740 --> 00:30.240
in human biology here. I'm from Reedley,

00:30.360 --> 00:32.060
California, which is a small agricultural

00:32.060 --> 00:34.280
town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents

00:34.280 --> 00:36.260
are migrant workers, and I've worked in

00:36.260 --> 00:38.180
the fields with them all my life, up until

00:38.180 --> 00:43.320
I started coming to school. My name is Eva

00:43.320 --> 00:46.240
Silva. I'm a senior majoring in human

00:46.240 --> 00:49.320
biology with an emphasis on education in

00:49.320 --> 00:51.980
the diverse classroom. And I'm from

00:51.980 --> 00:54.840
Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a

00:54.840 --> 00:59.040
math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado

00:59.040 --> 01:01.420
and I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano

01:01.420 --> 01:05.400
Studies. I'm from a town in San Diego

01:05.400 --> 01:12.040
called Escondido and what else? That's it

01:12.040 --> 01:17.200
for now. My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna. I

01:17.200 --> 01:19.900
am a senior majoring in public policy with

01:19.900 --> 01:24.100
a focus on on education. And I'm from

01:24.100 --> 01:28.120
Burbank, California, and I'm going to be a

01:28.120 --> 01:31.180
social studies high school teacher.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.580
Do you want to ask some questions here as

01:38.580 --> 01:42.340
to how this started? In your own words,

01:42.460 --> 01:44.860
how did it start? How did this hunter

01:44.860 --> 01:45.980
strike start and why? Why?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.040
How did it start? Speak to us as if we

01:53.040 --> 01:56.260
don't know. Okay. Speak to me like you do.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.240
Well, I guess it was a buildup of a lot of

01:59.240 --> 02:01.280
different things that have been happening,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.920
not only on this campus, but overall in

02:03.920 --> 02:07.460
this nation with the status of Chicanos

02:07.460 --> 02:10.580
and Chicanas in the United States, in the

02:10.580 --> 02:14.380
universities and everywhere else. So, you

02:14.380 --> 02:18.760
know, I guess I can run down, like, since

02:18.760 --> 02:20.120
my freshman year, so many things have

02:20.120 --> 02:22.080
happened, the closing down of the Office

02:22.080 --> 02:26.320
of Chicano Affairs, and then with all the

02:26.320 --> 02:28.140
threats, with the budget cuts to the

02:28.140 --> 02:31.020
ethnic centers, and just these attacks on

02:31.020 --> 02:33.840
the theme houses, on the ethnic centers,

02:33.900 --> 02:37.060
and everything else, and then the laying

02:37.060 --> 02:41.240
off of Cecilia Burciaga. I mean everything

02:41.240 --> 02:43.760
just like piled down piled down and so

02:43.760 --> 02:46.200
many things are happening that we say wait

02:46.200 --> 02:48.060
we need to do something about it and we

02:48.060 --> 02:49.960
need to change what's going on because

02:49.960 --> 02:54.740
nothing's happening that we want to happen

02:55.480 --> 02:58.340
I'm tired, I'm sorry. No, you sound good.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.520
Some people wonder why you would need to

03:00.520 --> 03:02.980
take a drastic measure like this. I think

03:02.980 --> 03:05.620
you'll say why didn't you? Because the

03:05.620 --> 03:07.560
administration has been very, whenever

03:07.560 --> 03:10.600
we've had like meetings and townhouse

03:10.600 --> 03:11.920
meetings or whatever, get togethers with

03:11.920 --> 03:15.060
any of the administrators, we don't get

03:15.060 --> 03:17.680
any results that we're happy with. And so

03:17.680 --> 03:19.080
it seemed to me like for them to really

03:19.080 --> 03:21.240
understand how extreme the situation is on

03:21.240 --> 03:23.700
this campus and how extreme things are

03:23.700 --> 03:25.800
outside in terms of immigrant bashing and

03:25.800 --> 03:29.480
just the way that people in Ispa Lo Alto

03:29.480 --> 03:31.960
are, that it was maybe the only way that

03:31.960 --> 03:33.700
they would, I don't know if it would touch

03:33.700 --> 03:35.200
their heart or if they would just stop to

03:35.200 --> 03:37.380
think about it or if we could get enough

03:37.380 --> 03:39.520
bad press for this university so that they

03:39.520 --> 03:41.140
could finally just really think about it.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.960
Because otherwise they weren't paying

03:42.960 --> 03:44.780
attention. It was just like everything had

03:44.780 --> 03:46.860
to go business as usual and there seemed

03:46.860 --> 03:49.260
to be this idea about hierarchy here that

03:49.260 --> 03:51.300
it was from top down it was what they said

03:51.300 --> 03:53.480
first and then if we could deal with that

03:53.480 --> 03:56.280
if we as students could deal with what the

03:56.280 --> 03:57.880
university wanted well then that was fine

03:57.880 --> 03:59.840
and if we couldn't that's too bad because

03:59.840 --> 04:01.800
they're at their position because you know

04:01.800 --> 04:05.540
they earned it or whatever yeah because

04:05.540 --> 04:09.300
meeting after meeting like you didn't get

04:09.300 --> 04:12.240
anything concrete from meeting with them

04:12.240 --> 04:14.380
every single time it was just okay I'll

04:14.380 --> 04:15.580
give I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7,

04:15.600 --> 04:17.820
I'll give you a meeting from 5.30 to 6 or

04:17.820 --> 04:22.000
whatever. We've tried their methods. We've

04:22.000 --> 04:25.380
tried their methods of working things out.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.940
And their methods are to draw things out

04:27.940 --> 04:31.420
for as long as possible in order to not

04:31.420 --> 04:33.200
give us things. At least, you know, they

04:33.200 --> 04:35.240
may say differently, but that's what it

04:35.240 --> 04:38.540
feels like. And it's ridiculous to have to

04:38.540 --> 04:42.160
spend... I'm sorry I'm slow, but I'm a

04:42.160 --> 04:44.840
little bit tired. It's ridiculous to spend

04:44.840 --> 04:46.480
so much time just talking and talking

04:46.480 --> 04:49.320
about things. And they're trying to tire

04:49.320 --> 04:53.500
us out with just talking. So that's what

04:53.500 --> 04:55.720
it had to come to. And when people are not

04:55.720 --> 04:58.560
heard, and this happens in society at

04:58.560 --> 05:01.700
large, when people are not heard, yeah, I

05:01.700 --> 05:04.480
don't know if I want to say abnormal

05:04.480 --> 05:07.000
behaviors, but behaviors that are not

05:07.000 --> 05:12.460
normal are what happen. And yeah, this is

05:12.460 --> 05:15.000
not normal. This is not normal behavior

05:15.000 --> 05:20.840
for us to be not eating. But you know... I

05:20.840 --> 05:22.840
really like to eat. Yeah, we like to eat.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.520
And I emphasize, you know, why are

05:27.520 --> 05:29.360
Chicanos in prison? Why are Chicanos in

05:29.360 --> 05:32.160
poverty? That's not normal. That's not

05:32.160 --> 05:34.980
normal for people. But because of society,

05:35.200 --> 05:38.080
that's how we are. We've waited long

05:38.080 --> 05:40.740
enough for this. I mean, I know the

05:40.740 --> 05:42.240
administration is probably thinking, well,

05:42.260 --> 05:43.900
you know, be patient and these changes

05:43.900 --> 05:46.240
will happen. But we've been patient long

05:46.240 --> 05:49.660
enough. And, you know, the Chicano Studies

05:49.660 --> 05:53.280
major has been, was envisioned back in the

05:53.280 --> 05:58.360
70s, even the 60s. And we've been waiting

05:58.360 --> 06:00.640
since then. And it's about time that we

06:00.640 --> 06:04.300
get recognized. You know, Chicanos are the

06:04.300 --> 06:08.200
biggest, are coming to be a majority in

06:08.200 --> 06:11.280
California. you know, maybe even in the

06:11.280 --> 06:14.100
whole country after a while, but I mean

06:14.100 --> 06:15.680
it's about time that our issues get

06:15.680 --> 06:18.380
recognized and that other people just

06:18.380 --> 06:22.080
realize that we're not going to go away.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.400
And if they don't educate themselves about

06:24.400 --> 06:27.940
us, then it's just going to be worse for

06:27.940 --> 06:31.340
them. Julia, you co-authored a really

06:31.340 --> 06:33.320
beautiful poem entitled Somos Mujeres.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.040
What for you What do you think is the

06:35.040 --> 06:37.820
significance of having four Chicanas

06:37.820 --> 06:41.540
taking the Vanguard role in this movement,

06:41.760 --> 06:43.200
which is really bigger than this campus?

06:44.940 --> 06:48.860
For me, I mean... I don't know. We didn't

06:48.860 --> 06:50.740
really realize it was four women until

06:50.740 --> 06:53.880
somebody pointed it out to us. I mean, we

06:53.880 --> 06:56.280
knew it was girls, but we didn't see it

06:56.280 --> 06:59.200
like, you know, oh, there's no guys here,

06:59.360 --> 07:06.080
and what's up with the guys? but I don't

07:06.080 --> 07:07.460
know I mean we have a lot of supporters

07:07.460 --> 07:09.400
that are male and maybe they didn't say

07:09.400 --> 07:10.800
they're gonna go for the long run but

07:10.800 --> 07:13.400
they've been you know there the whole time

07:13.400 --> 07:16.340
everybody like has had has their roles and

07:16.340 --> 07:19.700
it's like there's some people that are the

07:19.700 --> 07:21.360
negotiators there's people that are

07:21.360 --> 07:23.300
security over here there's like everybody

07:23.300 --> 07:27.180
has a roles and you know we're not the the

07:27.180 --> 07:29.160
most important because if it wasn't for

07:29.160 --> 07:31.180
them then you know nobody would be

07:31.180 --> 07:33.080
listening to us or whatever and there's

07:33.080 --> 07:34.860
other people that have been fasting also

07:34.860 --> 07:38.220
like Felipe sitting over there again he's

07:38.220 --> 07:40.320
been fasting these three days with us as

07:40.320 --> 07:41.400
well and like there's people that

07:41.400 --> 07:43.540
committed to three days and others that do

07:43.540 --> 07:46.280
one one day cycles to show their support

07:46.280 --> 07:50.140
and solidarity it's true there are a lot

07:50.140 --> 07:53.360
of males that are doing really important

07:53.360 --> 07:54.840
stuff in terms of really trying you know

07:54.840 --> 07:56.580
like with the rest of the women also

07:56.580 --> 07:58.480
trying to take care of us and and trying

07:58.480 --> 08:00.000
to watch out for this, and they're just

08:00.000 --> 08:02.600
constantly looking out to see what we need

08:02.600 --> 08:05.000
or what needs to be done for the whole

08:05.000 --> 08:06.780
group. And so it's, I don't know, I don't

08:06.780 --> 08:08.900
know that it's specifically a female thing

08:08.900 --> 08:11.260
to be fasting or anything like that. Yeah,

08:11.280 --> 08:12.600
because I think... Because everybody

08:12.600 --> 08:14.540
really does have their own role, and

08:14.540 --> 08:16.500
everybody's been really supportive, and

08:16.500 --> 08:19.480
we're working together. It just so

08:19.480 --> 08:22.600
happened that we're the ones that... It

08:22.600 --> 08:28.700
was quite... that we're the ones that were

08:28.700 --> 08:33.800
ready mentally at this time to fast. And

08:33.800 --> 08:36.440
it just so happens that we're all women.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.300
People are calling us guerrillas and

08:40.300 --> 08:42.160
revolucionarias.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.180
That's fine. That's nice. That's really

08:49.180 --> 08:52.340
nice. But everybody's been revolutionary.

08:52.340 --> 08:59.160
And it comes down to what your, I don't

08:59.160 --> 09:01.100
want to say your talents, because I don't

09:01.100 --> 09:02.620
think our talent is to be hungry, but

09:02.620 --> 09:06.580
pretty much everybody is taking on the

09:06.580 --> 09:08.600
role that is best suited for themselves.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.640
There's Felipe. There's Felipe. You have

09:18.640 --> 09:20.240
all the things that you could have done,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.800
all the actions you could have taken. Why

09:22.800 --> 09:26.280
fasting? Why did you choose to fast?

09:29.500 --> 09:32.720
Well, it's obviously a really strong

09:32.720 --> 09:35.440
statement. You know, it's something that,

09:35.460 --> 09:40.040
it's uncompromising, and it's something

09:40.040 --> 09:42.540
that shows just how serious we are about

09:42.540 --> 09:45.380
these issues. They're issues that our

09:45.380 --> 09:47.120
fathers, grandfathers, and people way

09:47.120 --> 09:49.580
before us, and have fought for them. We

09:49.580 --> 09:52.180
have a responsibility to those ancestors

09:52.180 --> 09:54.600
of ours to make sure that those dreams

09:54.600 --> 09:57.800
that they had, that vision they had is

09:57.800 --> 10:00.120
fulfilled. We can't just, you know, it may

10:00.120 --> 10:03.920
be 20 years, 20, 30, 20 years later from

10:03.920 --> 10:06.320
the Chicano movement that people think is

10:06.320 --> 10:08.000
dead, but it's not dead. We're here and

10:08.000 --> 10:09.140
we're living and we're the Chicano

10:09.140 --> 10:12.620
movement. And Chicana movement. Yeah.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.860
Chicano, Chicana. Chicano movement.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.840
Felipe, you just joined us, but actually

10:19.840 --> 10:21.240
you've been with us throughout this whole

10:21.240 --> 10:23.360
struggle from the beginning as it was

10:23.360 --> 10:25.220
pointed out. Can you tell us a little bit

10:25.220 --> 10:27.280
about yourself, where you're from, and

10:27.280 --> 10:30.800
your reflection on this struggle? Sure. My

10:30.800 --> 10:33.080
name is Felipe Barayan. I'm a freshman,

10:33.300 --> 10:36.960
originally from Los Angeles, California.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.740
This struggle, I think for me, it's

10:41.740 --> 10:44.640
something that's very important because I

10:44.640 --> 10:47.720
went to high school in Watts and a lot of

10:47.720 --> 10:50.040
people know what Watts is like, 1965,

10:51.380 --> 10:53.520
Watts Rebellion, the Ninety-Two Riots.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.860
There I saw issues that the educational

10:57.860 --> 11:00.280
system for high school students and

11:00.280 --> 11:02.260
Chicano-Tatinos there wasn't addressing

11:02.260 --> 11:05.420
the real issues. Once I came here, I got a

11:05.420 --> 11:08.360
taste of it, I got a taste of Chicano

11:08.360 --> 11:10.820
studies and I found out how crucial that

11:10.820 --> 11:15.580
was. And I think that getting involved

11:15.580 --> 11:17.920
with the struggle is important for me to

11:17.920 --> 11:22.380
build the processes with which we learn to

11:22.380 --> 11:24.620
deal with inner city to wipe out the

11:24.620 --> 11:27.140
marginalization of our people.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.560
In terms of your actions, a lot of people

11:34.560 --> 11:36.860
are probably thinking that you came here

11:36.860 --> 11:39.160
to study and that you should be in the

11:39.160 --> 11:42.540
classroom, not protesting.

11:43.980 --> 11:47.460
So you're making a decision because it is

11:47.460 --> 11:50.920
a pretty tough university to be at and

11:50.920 --> 11:53.220
there's a lot of demands and you're kind

11:53.220 --> 11:56.140
of out there really taking a big chance.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.800
How did you make that decision? See, I

12:00.800 --> 12:04.560
guess, like, the main thing is, is, like,

12:04.680 --> 12:08.340
I never, like, when I came here, I didn't

12:08.340 --> 12:12.100
want to come and just study and go to

12:12.100 --> 12:15.380
class and go back home, study, do my work,

12:15.400 --> 12:17.360
and just concentrate on myself. While

12:17.360 --> 12:19.280
there's people out there, there's students

12:19.280 --> 12:20.980
in the high schools that are getting

12:20.980 --> 12:23.300
pushed out of the schools, there's the

12:23.300 --> 12:24.940
farm workers that are getting treated

12:24.940 --> 12:26.600
badly, there's kids being born without

12:26.600 --> 12:28.380
hands because of the pesticides that they

12:28.380 --> 12:30.140
put on the grapes. I mean, I can't just

12:30.140 --> 12:32.740
sit and concentrate on my own work and not

12:32.740 --> 12:35.280
worry about what's going on because that's

12:35.280 --> 12:38.380
my people, that's my parents, that's my

12:38.380 --> 12:41.520
family, that's everybody. And I wouldn't

12:41.520 --> 12:43.520
be able to live with myself without doing

12:43.520 --> 12:45.280
anything about it. I wouldn't be able to

12:45.280 --> 12:46.860
live with myself with just thinking about

12:46.860 --> 12:49.020
myself and my career and getting straight

12:49.020 --> 12:51.160
A's and doing my resumes and stuff like

12:51.160 --> 12:52.880
that. I wouldn't be able to do that. I

12:52.880 --> 12:55.720
mean both things can be done. And also

12:55.720 --> 12:58.240
like I think that we're doing this so that

12:58.240 --> 13:00.540
you know later generations of Stanford

13:00.540 --> 13:03.120
Chicanos and Chicanas don't have to do it.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.820
Today we had you know little Chicanitas

13:05.820 --> 13:07.620
and Chicanitos from East Palo Alto come

13:07.620 --> 13:10.660
out and from a group called Raices de

13:10.660 --> 13:12.840
Mexico and they came out and they're you

13:12.840 --> 13:15.160
know they they came and supported us. You

13:15.160 --> 13:16.700
know, they're just little kids. I don't

13:16.700 --> 13:19.100
know, they're probably like from 5 to like

13:19.100 --> 13:21.580
12 maybe. And, you know, the reason we're

13:21.580 --> 13:23.320
doing this now and sacrificing our

13:23.320 --> 13:26.660
academic times or study hours or whatever,

13:28.840 --> 13:30.960
so that they, when they come here, you

13:30.960 --> 13:35.920
know, they can focus, you know, on doing

13:35.920 --> 13:38.480
the things that they need to do instead of

13:38.480 --> 13:41.300
having to struggle so much. I mean, I

13:41.300 --> 13:42.680
think it's just like our parents, you

13:42.680 --> 13:44.120
know. They struggle so that we don't have

13:44.120 --> 13:46.000
to struggle. And we don't, I mean, we

13:46.000 --> 13:48.700
don't... We're still struggling, but at a

13:48.700 --> 13:50.000
different level. You know what I mean?

13:50.400 --> 13:53.500
We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry,

13:53.580 --> 13:55.160
once we get out of here, we're not going

13:55.160 --> 13:56.760
to have to worry about where am I going to

13:56.760 --> 13:59.080
get something to eat, like before. Or how

13:59.080 --> 14:00.700
are we going to pay the bills. We're

14:00.700 --> 14:01.980
probably going to have to, you know, we're

14:01.980 --> 14:03.400
probably going to be able to pay even our

14:03.400 --> 14:07.340
parents' bills. Hopefully, yeah. Yeah, I

14:07.340 --> 14:09.240
think the teachers are going to teach us

14:09.240 --> 14:13.880
how to eat. I think it also goes back to

14:13.880 --> 14:16.560
the question about why did we choose a

14:16.560 --> 14:18.340
hunger strike. It's kind of like, you

14:18.340 --> 14:20.560
know, we know that our grades are going to

14:20.560 --> 14:21.980
suffer from this and we're not going to

14:21.980 --> 14:25.580
graduate with a great GPA, you know, as we

14:25.580 --> 14:27.980
could have. And I mean, it's to show that,

14:28.060 --> 14:30.820
I mean, we know that we're capable of

14:30.820 --> 14:34.840
doing a work, but we feel so strongly

14:34.840 --> 14:36.720
about this that we're willing to do a

14:36.720 --> 14:39.020
little bit, you know, worse than everybody

14:39.020 --> 14:41.260
else because our issues are so important.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.140
I mean, I think, I don't know if the

14:46.140 --> 14:49.480
administration sees that, but I don't know

14:49.480 --> 14:54.100
if anybody sees that. But I mean, you

14:54.100 --> 14:56.680
know, I know that I could be a nice

14:56.680 --> 15:01.140
student, you know, but, you know, I choose

15:01.140 --> 15:05.560
to better be like, to be a human being

15:05.560 --> 15:08.860
first and to care more about my people

15:08.860 --> 15:12.680
than about my grades. I was going to ask

15:12.680 --> 15:15.320
you, related to the incident that happened

15:15.320 --> 15:18.180
on Sunday at the Flix, at the film,

15:18.280 --> 15:23.520
Notaries of Sholom, how do you feel, or

15:23.520 --> 15:26.400
what steps can the university take to

15:26.400 --> 15:30.140
educate the student community, even staff

15:30.140 --> 15:33.960
and faculty, about the issue of ongoing

15:33.960 --> 15:36.980
racism, the issue of why it's important to

15:36.980 --> 15:40.100
have abandoned graves on this campus. How

15:40.100 --> 15:42.300
do you think the university can take a

15:42.300 --> 15:46.260
proactive role in educating the community?

15:46.640 --> 15:49.940
I think if they really truly believe that

15:49.940 --> 15:51.840
that isn't right, that the incident at

15:51.840 --> 15:54.260
Flix isn't right, or that people should

15:54.260 --> 15:58.500
know and should understand that the

15:58.500 --> 16:00.420
pesticides and the harm that they're doing

16:00.420 --> 16:02.760
to people is wrong, then they should take

16:02.760 --> 16:04.020
it upon themselves to educate this

16:04.020 --> 16:05.000
university. If they really feel

16:05.000 --> 16:06.400
responsible for the education of their

16:06.400 --> 16:08.480
students, if they really, if they believe

16:08.480 --> 16:09.860
that that is an important issue, that

16:09.860 --> 16:12.360
people's lives and people's health and the

16:12.360 --> 16:14.680
reaction of some or a lot of students

16:14.680 --> 16:18.460
finding that amusing, there's something

16:18.460 --> 16:19.340
wrong with that. that there's something

16:19.340 --> 16:21.140
wrong with the mentality or with the

16:21.140 --> 16:23.280
ignorance level or something of the

16:23.280 --> 16:25.420
students at this university. And they are

16:25.420 --> 16:27.280
responsible because they're the

16:27.280 --> 16:28.620
administrators, they're in charge of this

16:28.620 --> 16:31.700
school. They're here to serve the

16:31.700 --> 16:33.400
students, but they're also here to help

16:33.400 --> 16:35.500
educate them. And there's, I mean, to me

16:35.500 --> 16:36.960
that proved just a lot of ignorance. It

16:36.960 --> 16:38.680
didn't surprise me, but it was very

16:38.680 --> 16:40.080
offensive and it was very disrespectful.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.080
And if they really, if they agree with

16:42.080 --> 16:43.820
that at all, then it's their

16:43.820 --> 16:47.040
responsibility to deal with it. I mean the

16:47.040 --> 16:49.880
main things that were, you know, just to

16:49.880 --> 16:54.540
bring up what we're striking about, we

16:54.540 --> 16:57.760
have these issues that we have been

16:57.760 --> 16:59.560
dealing with as a community for a long

16:59.560 --> 17:04.420
time. And you know, one of them being a

17:04.420 --> 17:09.680
campus ban on grapes, the development of a

17:09.680 --> 17:13.020
Chicano studies program and the community

17:13.020 --> 17:17.940
center in Hispano Alto. And you know,

17:17.960 --> 17:19.640
these are things that we can talk about

17:19.640 --> 17:25.140
specifically. And the offer for Cecilia

17:25.140 --> 17:27.060
Bulciaga. And the offer for a high level

17:27.060 --> 17:29.900
position for Cecilia Bulciaga, a high

17:29.900 --> 17:33.500
level administrator here. Chicama

17:33.500 --> 17:36.980
administrator. Why is it important for the

17:36.980 --> 17:38.460
university to recognize recognize

17:38.460 --> 17:44.400
Cecilia's contributions. Why Cecilia's

17:44.400 --> 17:47.560
position, Cecilia's role included among

17:47.560 --> 17:52.180
these other three? Well, basically because

17:52.180 --> 17:55.060
it ties down to the whole approach that

17:55.060 --> 17:56.900
we're taking that our education isn't

17:56.900 --> 17:58.960
addressing the real issues. You know, the

17:58.960 --> 18:01.780
issues being poverty, the joblessness,

18:01.780 --> 18:06.180
homelessness, and the over-representation

18:06.180 --> 18:08.680
we have in the jails, and just everything.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.120
And she ties into that because Cecilia has

18:12.120 --> 18:15.340
always worked for those issues. She was

18:15.340 --> 18:21.280
working on the Boycott Grapes campaign.

18:21.820 --> 18:24.680
And when she gets here, I mean, when she's

18:24.680 --> 18:28.280
here, you get here. I mean, she's like a

18:28.280 --> 18:36.600
role model. A role model. What is this? A

18:36.600 --> 18:41.700
role mother. Oh, man, I'm getting tired.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.480
Oh, no. Yeah, what we're talking about,

18:46.520 --> 18:50.520
she's a role model and a role mother.

18:51.700 --> 18:55.600
Mother figure. Mother figure. That's it.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.900
No, I guess basically because she helps in

18:58.900 --> 19:02.420
just keeping us here. Because it's hard to

19:02.420 --> 19:04.800
survive in a campus like this when you

19:04.800 --> 19:06.880
have people, like, Sunday nights at Flick

19:06.880 --> 19:09.600
saying, Beaners, go home, or, you know,

19:09.620 --> 19:11.900
saying stuff like that here at Stanford. I

19:11.900 --> 19:13.980
mean, how are we supposed to survive in a

19:13.980 --> 19:16.320
climate that doesn't even accept us, that

19:16.320 --> 19:18.020
you have to justify your existence? And

19:18.020 --> 19:20.860
you need people like Cecilia Burciaga and

19:20.860 --> 19:24.720
like Francis that just help you out just

19:24.720 --> 19:27.000
to make, like, especially the transition

19:27.000 --> 19:29.200
from, like, your first year. I mean,

19:29.240 --> 19:31.220
that's what helped me so much living in

19:31.220 --> 19:33.560
Zapata my very first year is, you know, I

19:33.560 --> 19:36.000
survived the whole year because I was

19:36.000 --> 19:38.540
living there, I think. Because, I mean,

19:38.560 --> 19:40.660
she helped out a lot, like, with my

19:40.660 --> 19:43.780
parents and just everything. I mean, I

19:43.780 --> 19:46.800
think, like, they're always caring for

19:46.800 --> 19:49.240
you. She's an important contact for us. I

19:49.240 --> 19:52.440
mean, there's so few of us here. And then

19:52.440 --> 19:56.580
there's so few of our, you know, Chicano

19:56.580 --> 19:58.940
and Chicana role models here that we can,

19:58.960 --> 20:00.860
you know, talk to and say, you know, hey,

20:00.960 --> 20:03.000
you know, this happened to me today. Or,

20:03.060 --> 20:05.500
you know, I really, it's really strange

20:05.500 --> 20:08.280
for me to be here and not be back home

20:08.280 --> 20:10.100
where I see a lot of people who look like

20:10.100 --> 20:12.280
myself, you know. And these are people

20:12.280 --> 20:14.360
that you can talk to. too. Like Cecilia,

20:14.520 --> 20:17.700
you know, she's, she's, I mean, I find it

20:17.700 --> 20:20.060
incredible, she always has time to hear us

20:20.060 --> 20:24.680
out. Always. Yeah, when, um, when I was a

20:24.680 --> 20:27.180
freshman, like, I have a really nice story

20:27.180 --> 20:31.340
about her, that, um, when I, well, I

20:31.340 --> 20:34.400
didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get

20:34.400 --> 20:36.740
to live in Zapata my freshman year. And

20:36.740 --> 20:39.480
so, so, like, I had a lot of problems,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.360
like, just trying to adapt and and trying

20:41.360 --> 20:44.200
to decide what I was going to do with my

20:44.200 --> 20:46.020
life. And I had this whole big problem

20:46.020 --> 20:48.100
about deciding whether to be a doctor and

20:48.100 --> 20:51.420
secure a good financial future for myself

20:51.420 --> 20:53.240
and for my family or do what I really

20:53.240 --> 20:54.980
wanted to do, which was to be a teacher.

20:55.380 --> 21:00.360
And my freshman advisor recommended that I

21:00.360 --> 21:02.280
go to her because he had heard so many

21:02.280 --> 21:04.340
nice things about her that he thought she

21:04.340 --> 21:06.440
could help me. And I remember going into

21:06.440 --> 21:09.460
her office and just, like, crying my guts

21:09.460 --> 21:12.260
out because I didn't know where I fit into

21:12.260 --> 21:17.920
this university. And she had time. She sat

21:17.920 --> 21:20.660
with me in her office and talked to me and

21:20.660 --> 21:24.320
encouraged me to do what I felt was right,

21:24.480 --> 21:29.940
to let my heart decide. And, I mean, for

21:29.940 --> 21:32.660
the university not to recognize that she

21:32.660 --> 21:35.560
is capable of keeping me here because I

21:35.560 --> 21:38.380
was ready to leave. leave. And she

21:38.380 --> 21:42.740
literally helped me to stay. And if it

21:42.740 --> 21:44.400
wasn't for her, I mean, I wouldn't be

21:44.400 --> 21:48.540
here. All of you are members of MECHA,

21:48.660 --> 21:50.500
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanos. That's

21:50.500 --> 21:55.220
long history. What is the significance of

21:55.220 --> 21:57.260
this new phase? And I'm referring

21:57.260 --> 22:01.440
specifically to the various events that

22:01.440 --> 22:04.480
started at UCLA, UC Santa Barbara,

22:05.220 --> 22:06.920
Colorado, University of Colorado, and

22:06.920 --> 22:09.520
Michigan State. Virginia too. Virginia

22:09.520 --> 22:11.820
too. Can you talk about this in the

22:11.820 --> 22:15.600
context of the overall resurgence of Mecha

22:15.600 --> 22:20.460
and Chicano student activism? I think as

22:20.460 --> 22:23.820
Mecha is the Chicano student movement, and

22:23.820 --> 22:25.500
there's a long history of activism there,

22:25.620 --> 22:28.820
dating back to the original planet and I

22:28.820 --> 22:33.780
think that each of us has maintained that

22:33.780 --> 22:40.460
goal of the betterment of La Raza. And our

22:40.460 --> 22:45.060
Mecha is very strong and we support with

22:45.060 --> 22:49.840
those founding Mechistas came up with in

22:49.840 --> 22:52.740
terms of the Plan de Santa Barbara. and

22:52.740 --> 22:56.480
it's gaining its and UCLA and UC Santa

22:56.480 --> 22:59.780
Barbara and other universities Mecha

22:59.780 --> 23:03.780
members and other organizations are taking

23:03.780 --> 23:06.880
the leadership and moving the universities

23:06.880 --> 23:10.860
to meet the demands the thing is playing

23:10.860 --> 23:11.600
instrumental role

23:16.480 --> 23:18.340
They got misquoted? They're going to print

23:18.340 --> 23:20.540
tomorrow. Are they in support? Yeah. We're

23:20.540 --> 23:22.780
rolling. So what happened? They're going

23:22.780 --> 23:25.740
to print tomorrow. That sucks, man. I feel

23:25.740 --> 23:31.620
bad for mine. Oh yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I was

23:31.620 --> 23:33.560
going to ask you, I know earlier I talked

23:33.560 --> 23:39.220
to your dad and I talked to your mom. I

23:39.220 --> 23:42.120
know from them that it's been really hard

23:42.120 --> 23:43.860
for them. I mean, they haven't been eating

23:43.860 --> 23:47.660
as well. They're also, in a way, also in

23:47.660 --> 23:50.440
the hunger strike. How do you feel?
