WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.020
One in the middle that's taken. One over

00:03.020 --> 00:05.820
here, two over here. Maybe people in the

00:05.820 --> 00:06.700
aisles can move in.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.080
Any more? A couple over here.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.880
My name is Wanda Korn. I'm director of the

00:33.880 --> 00:36.500
Stanford Humanities Center. It's the

00:36.500 --> 00:38.820
Stanford Humanities Center, which is a

00:38.820 --> 00:41.440
research institute on campus dedicated to

00:41.440 --> 00:43.700
arts and letters, that has been hosting

00:43.700 --> 00:45.640
Joseph Brodsky's visit here this week.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.980
This is the last of four public

00:48.980 --> 00:53.360
presentations and many more informal ones

00:53.360 --> 00:56.140
that Mr. Brodsky has made on campus this

00:56.140 --> 00:59.300
week. In fact, as a matter of curiosity, I

00:59.300 --> 01:00.940
wonder how many of you in the audience

01:00.940 --> 01:03.800
tonight have attended another event with

01:03.800 --> 01:10.020
our visitor this week. Thank you. For

01:10.020 --> 01:11.920
those of you who have been able to hear

01:11.920 --> 01:15.000
Mr. Brodsky this week, each time on a

01:15.000 --> 01:17.680
different subject, I'm sure you would

01:17.680 --> 01:19.420
agree that there is something very special

01:19.420 --> 01:21.480
and unusual about about having the

01:21.480 --> 01:24.820
opportunity to hear a gifted person give,

01:24.920 --> 01:27.280
as it were, different pieces of himself in

01:27.280 --> 01:31.320
a concentrated period of time. While an

01:31.320 --> 01:34.620
exhausting marathon for our speaker, it is

01:34.620 --> 01:36.700
extremely enriching for those on campus.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.500
And by way of introduction, I want to tell

01:40.500 --> 01:43.140
you how Joseph Brodsky's visit came about.

01:43.140 --> 01:47.420
out. If you've read your program, you know

01:47.420 --> 01:49.400
that Rhoda and Elliot Leventhal

01:49.400 --> 01:52.320
established a new endowment last year at

01:52.320 --> 01:55.140
the Stanford Humanities Center, one that

01:55.140 --> 01:57.420
they specially designed to bring to campus

01:57.420 --> 02:00.640
persons of significant achievement in

02:00.640 --> 02:03.860
humanities and world affairs. It was the

02:03.860 --> 02:05.980
Leventhal's idea that this visitor should

02:05.980 --> 02:08.320
not just come, give a lecture or reading,

02:08.480 --> 02:11.160
and go, but rather to stay long enough on

02:11.160 --> 02:13.080
campus to have significant interaction

02:13.080 --> 02:16.080
with students, faculty, and others in the

02:16.080 --> 02:19.620
Stanford community. Joseph Brodsky has

02:19.620 --> 02:21.600
been the first Leventhal distinguished

02:22.010 --> 02:24.960
visitor and a most generous visitor he has

02:24.960 --> 02:28.720
been. Listening to his presentations has

02:28.720 --> 02:30.380
been rather like absorbing a cubist

02:30.380 --> 02:33.460
painting, a new facet or layer building

02:33.460 --> 02:35.480
each day into into a fuller portrait.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.040
Monday, the Mount Holyoke teacher of

02:39.040 --> 02:41.820
literature. Tuesday, the meditative

02:41.820 --> 02:44.380
essayist that we read in the New Republic

02:44.380 --> 02:45.920
and the New York Review of Books.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.400
Wednesday, the seasoned and mature poet

02:49.740 --> 02:52.420
talking about his craft. And tonight,

02:52.620 --> 02:55.280
Thursday, the Nobel Prize winning poet and

02:55.280 --> 02:57.480
fifth poet laureate of the United States.

02:58.820 --> 03:02.600
I'm reminded at the end of this week of

03:02.600 --> 03:05.320
one of the qualities Mr. Brodsky said he

03:05.320 --> 03:08.100
admired in the poetry of Thomas Hardy and

03:08.100 --> 03:10.980
Robert Frost a quality called expansive

03:10.980 --> 03:14.060
motion. The expansive motion of a line.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.440
It's continually opening out. It's a

03:17.440 --> 03:20.660
similar expansiveness and unfolding that

03:20.660 --> 03:22.560
so many of us have experienced this week

03:22.560 --> 03:26.120
in the man himself. So in your welcoming

03:26.120 --> 03:28.620
applause I hope you will pay tribute

03:28.620 --> 03:31.700
tonight not only to the poet, artist,

03:31.940 --> 03:34.340
teacher, philosopher who will read for us

03:34.340 --> 03:37.180
this evening, but also include a thank you

03:37.180 --> 03:39.660
to the Leventhals who made it possible for

03:39.660 --> 03:42.320
him to spend this full week at Stanford.

03:42.580 --> 03:45.120
Thank you, Joseph. Thank you, Rhoda and

03:45.120 --> 03:45.360
Elliot.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.360
Thank you.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.000
Good evening.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.580
We'll be here for about one hour, and in

04:17.580 --> 04:20.200
the course of that hour, I'm going to read

04:20.200 --> 04:23.680
you a few poems. Most of them I'll read to

04:23.680 --> 04:25.000
you in English, but three or four,

04:25.080 --> 04:27.780
presumably, I will read both in English

04:27.780 --> 04:31.060
and in Russian. I wish actually it were

04:31.060 --> 04:35.960
the other way around because English is

04:35.960 --> 04:38.140
far from being my mother tongue and well,

04:38.280 --> 04:42.180
there's plenty of accent in it. So the

04:42.180 --> 04:46.720
only thing I can, well, I cannot hope for

04:46.720 --> 04:50.120
you is your indulgence and I'll try to do

04:50.120 --> 04:53.420
my level best.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.040
Well, I would like to start. I'm not so

05:02.040 --> 05:06.200
sure that this is a true thing that I'm

05:06.200 --> 05:07.620
trying to say that I would like to start.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.600
Actually, I wouldn't like to start at all.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.480
But I think I would like, I think I will

05:18.480 --> 05:20.680
start with the poem.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.680
It's a somewhat oldish poem. It's the

05:26.680 --> 05:30.080
title of this poem is Letters from the

05:30.080 --> 05:33.500
Ming Dynasty. It consists of two parts.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.380
Obviously, Obviously these are not the

05:35.380 --> 05:39.620
real letters, it's a stylization. The

05:39.620 --> 05:44.880
poem, the first part is a letter by a

05:44.880 --> 05:50.520
woman by Kurtier, something like a lady in

05:50.520 --> 05:54.000
waiting to her traveling faraway husband.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.980
And the second poem is the husband's

05:56.980 --> 05:59.920
presumed reply. Oh, you ought to know for

05:59.920 --> 06:04.740
the purposes of the poem. well, I mean for

06:04.740 --> 06:06.380
the purposes of better grasping what's

06:06.380 --> 06:08.480
going on is that while the Ming Dynasty is

06:08.480 --> 06:12.520
about the most cruel dynasty in the

06:12.520 --> 06:15.280
history of China, it was awfully good on

06:15.280 --> 06:17.540
the artifacts as well. The red Ming vases

06:17.540 --> 06:21.480
are justly famous. The expression land

06:21.480 --> 06:25.760
under heaven stands for, it's a euphemism

06:25.760 --> 06:28.140
for the celestial empire, which is in its

06:28.140 --> 06:32.120
own right, the euphemic name for China and

06:32.120 --> 06:36.000
the word Li is something like one-third of

06:36.000 --> 06:40.200
a mile in length and well hieroglyphs

06:40.200 --> 06:41.720
obviously it's sort of some of the

06:41.720 --> 06:44.140
mistranslation the word hieroglyph it's

06:44.140 --> 06:49.780
always like a character. Well letters from

06:49.780 --> 06:53.380
the Ming dynasty. I read it to you in

06:53.380 --> 06:54.900
English and in Russian.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.720
Soon it will be 13 years soon it will be

07:02.720 --> 07:05.900
13 years since the nightingale fluttered

07:05.900 --> 07:09.180
out of its cage and vanished and at

07:09.180 --> 07:11.860
nightfall the Emperor washes down his

07:11.860 --> 07:14.040
medicine with the blood of another tailor

07:14.040 --> 07:17.420
then propped on silk pillows turns on a

07:17.420 --> 07:20.100
jeweled bird that lulls him with its level

07:20.100 --> 07:23.240
identical song. It's this sort of

07:23.240 --> 07:26.120
anniversary, unnumbered, wrong that we

07:26.120 --> 07:28.640
celebrate these days in our land and the

07:28.640 --> 07:31.240
heaven. The special mirror that smooths

07:31.240 --> 07:34.560
wrinkles even costs more every year. Our

07:34.560 --> 07:36.960
small garden is choked with weeds, the sky

07:36.960 --> 07:40.040
too is pierced by spires like pins in the

07:40.040 --> 07:42.120
shoulder blades of someone so sick that

07:42.120 --> 07:43.640
his back is all we're allowed to see.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.080
And begins to joke. This letter to you,

07:50.180 --> 07:54.280
beloved, from your wild duck is brushed on

07:54.280 --> 07:56.640
the scented rice paper given me by the

07:56.640 --> 08:00.340
empress. Lately there is no rice, but the

08:00.340 --> 08:04.820
flow of rice paper is endless. A thousand

08:04.820 --> 08:07.300
-lea long road starts with the first step

08:07.300 --> 08:10.600
as the proverb goes. Pity the road home

08:10.600 --> 08:13.220
doesn't depend on that same step. It

08:13.220 --> 08:15.840
exceeds ten times a thousand Li,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.140
especially counting from zeros. One

08:19.140 --> 08:23.180
thousand Li, two thousand Li. A thousand

08:23.180 --> 08:27.320
means thou shalt not ever see thy native

08:27.320 --> 08:30.000
place. And the meaninglessness, like a

08:30.000 --> 08:32.520
plague, spreads from words onto numbers,

08:32.700 --> 08:35.380
onto zeros especially. Wind blows us

08:35.380 --> 08:38.200
westward like the yellow tears from a

08:38.200 --> 08:40.840
dried pod there by the wall towers.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.600
Against it, man's figure is ugly and stiff

08:43.600 --> 08:46.180
as a frightening hieroglyph, as any

08:46.180 --> 08:49.280
illegible scripture at which one stares.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.680
This pull in one direction only has made

08:52.680 --> 08:55.040
me something elongated, like a horse's

08:55.040 --> 08:58.440
head, and all the body should do is span

08:58.440 --> 09:01.120
by its shadow, rustling across the wild

09:01.120 --> 09:04.740
barleys with a blade. I know the same poem

09:04.740 --> 09:07.920
in Russian. The letters of the Ming

09:07.920 --> 09:08.160
dynasty.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.660
not a happy, not a good anniversary

09:38.700 --> 09:42.720
special mirror smoothing wrinkles every

09:42.720 --> 09:46.120
year our little garden is born in decline

09:46.120 --> 09:49.120
the sky is also cut with spines like a

09:49.120 --> 09:50.820
shoulder blade and the back of a sick

09:50.820 --> 09:53.780
person whose back we only see and

09:53.780 --> 09:56.620
sometimes I explain to my son the nature

09:56.620 --> 09:59.260
of the Bogdekhan of the stars and he lets

09:59.260 --> 10:02.380
go of the joke this is a letter from you

10:05.660 --> 10:07.060
mitad

10:32.420 --> 10:37.740
отчитывая от о. Одна ли тысяча ли? Две ли

10:37.740 --> 10:42.260
тысяча ли? Тысяча означает, что ты сейчас

10:42.260 --> 10:45.420
вдали от родимого крова, и зараза

10:45.420 --> 10:48.540
бессмысленности со слова перекидывается на

10:48.540 --> 10:52.660
цифры, особенно на нули. Ветер несет нас

10:52.660 --> 10:56.900
на запад, как бурые семена из лопнувшего

10:56.900 --> 10:59.420
стручка туда, где стоит стена.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.080
Let's switch to something else. Yeah.

11:30.860 --> 11:31.560
Thanks.

11:38.660 --> 11:42.500
Well, the title of the next poem is

11:42.500 --> 11:44.300
Transatlantic.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.840
It's a short poem.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.400
The last twenty years were good for

11:54.400 --> 11:57.600
practically everybody save the dead. But

11:57.600 --> 12:00.800
maybe for them as well, maybe the Almighty

12:00.800 --> 12:03.600
himself has turned a bit bourgeois and

12:03.600 --> 12:06.440
uses a credit card, for otherwise time's

12:06.440 --> 12:09.140
passage makes no sense. Hence memories,

12:09.500 --> 12:12.600
recollections, values, deportment. One

12:12.600 --> 12:15.140
hopes one hasn't spent one's mother or

12:15.140 --> 12:16.980
father or both or a handful of friends

12:16.980 --> 12:19.900
entirely as this is to hound one's dreams.

12:20.180 --> 12:23.680
One's dreams, unlike the city, become less

12:23.680 --> 12:26.500
populous the older one gets. That's why

12:26.500 --> 12:29.940
the eternal rest cancels analysis. The

12:29.940 --> 12:32.560
last 20 years were good for practically

12:32.560 --> 12:34.860
everybody and constituted the afterlife

12:34.860 --> 12:36.980
for the dead. Its quality could be

12:36.980 --> 12:39.700
questioned, but not its duration. The

12:39.700 --> 12:42.000
dead, one assumes, would not mind

12:42.000 --> 12:44.600
attaining a homely status and sleep in

12:44.600 --> 12:47.220
archways or watch pregnant submarines

12:47.220 --> 12:50.040
returning to their native pen after a

12:50.040 --> 12:52.040
worldwide journey without destroying

12:52.040 --> 12:54.540
destroying life on earth without even a

12:54.540 --> 12:56.220
proper flag to hoist.

13:03.140 --> 13:07.500
The next poem is somewhat longish. Indeed,

13:07.580 --> 13:11.460
it's a fairly long poem. It's called An

13:11.460 --> 13:14.240
Admonition. Essentially, it's an advice to

13:14.240 --> 13:14.680
a traveler.

13:23.080 --> 13:23.760
Admonition.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.780
Trekking in Asia, spending nights in odd

13:30.780 --> 13:34.120
dwellings, in granaries, cabins, shacks,

13:34.280 --> 13:37.620
timber abodes whose thin squinted window

13:37.620 --> 13:40.500
panes harness the world, sleep dressed,

13:40.840 --> 13:43.200
wrapped in your sheepskin, and do your

13:43.200 --> 13:45.060
best always to tuck your head into the

13:45.060 --> 13:47.960
corner, as in the corner It's harder and a

13:47.960 --> 13:50.480
darkness of that to swing an axe over your

13:50.480 --> 13:53.080
heavy booze laden Gerd and to chop it off

13:53.080 --> 13:56.740
nicely Square the circle in short fear

13:56.740 --> 13:59.940
broil cheekbones Including the moons poke

13:59.940 --> 14:02.900
marked skin and prefer blue eyes to brown

14:02.900 --> 14:05.240
eyes Search hard for the blue ones

14:05.240 --> 14:07.400
Especially when the road takes you into

14:07.400 --> 14:10.080
the wood in dates thick on the whole for

14:10.080 --> 14:12.580
the as for the eyes One should watch for

14:12.580 --> 14:15.120
they cut, for at your last instant it's

14:15.120 --> 14:17.440
better to stare at that which though cold,

14:17.580 --> 14:20.840
pyramids sink through, ice may crack, yet

14:20.840 --> 14:22.600
wallowing in an ice hole is far better

14:22.600 --> 14:26.040
than in honey-like viscous lies. Always

14:26.040 --> 14:28.740
pick a house with baby clothes hanging out

14:28.740 --> 14:31.780
in the yard. Deal only with the over-50

14:31.780 --> 14:34.620
crowd. A hick at that age knows too much

14:34.620 --> 14:36.880
about faith to gain anything by attempting

14:36.880 --> 14:39.400
to bust your brain. Same thing as squaw.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.720
hide mine in your fur coats color or if

14:42.720 --> 14:44.540
you are traveling light in your brown

14:44.540 --> 14:46.960
culotte under the knee but not in your

14:46.960 --> 14:48.800
boots since they'll find the door easily

14:48.800 --> 14:52.220
there in Asia boots are the first to go in

14:52.220 --> 14:55.060
the mountains move slowly if you must

14:55.060 --> 14:58.300
creep then creep magnificent in the

14:58.300 --> 15:01.020
distance meaningless closer up mountains

15:01.020 --> 15:03.680
about the surface standing on end the

15:03.680 --> 15:05.500
snail like and it seems horizontal

15:05.500 --> 15:08.380
meandering trail is in fact vertical.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.900
Lying flat in the mountains, you stand.

15:11.980 --> 15:14.640
Standing up, you lie flat, which suggests

15:14.640 --> 15:16.500
your true freedom isn't falling down.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.720
That's the way it appears to conquer. Once

15:19.720 --> 15:22.460
in the mountains, vertigo ruptures fears.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.340
If somebody yells, hey stranger, don't

15:26.340 --> 15:29.640
answer. Play deaf and dumb. Even though

15:29.640 --> 15:31.640
you may know it, don't speak the tongue.

15:31.940 --> 15:35.140
Try not to stand out, either in profile or

15:35.140 --> 15:37.600
full face, simply don't wash your face at

15:37.600 --> 15:40.260
times. What's more, when the rip occurs,

15:40.500 --> 15:44.800
throw it with a saw, don't cringe. Smoking

15:44.800 --> 15:47.200
douse your butt with spittle and besides

15:47.200 --> 15:49.820
arrange to wear gray, the hue of the

15:49.820 --> 15:52.420
earth, especially under clothes, to reduce

15:52.420 --> 15:54.540
the temptation to blend your flesh with

15:54.540 --> 15:57.440
earth. When you hold in the desert, make

15:57.440 --> 15:59.680
an arrow from pebbles, so if suddenly

15:59.680 --> 16:01.640
Suddenly woken up, you grasp which way to

16:01.640 --> 16:04.580
go in the darkness. At night, demons in

16:04.580 --> 16:07.580
deserts try travelers' hearts. One who

16:07.580 --> 16:10.260
heeds their cry is easily disoriented. One

16:10.260 --> 16:13.100
steps sideways and well, said two. Ghosts,

16:13.100 --> 16:15.000
specters, demons are at home in the

16:15.000 --> 16:17.040
desert. You too will discover that's true

16:17.040 --> 16:20.080
when sand creaking under your soul. All

16:20.080 --> 16:22.600
that remains of you is your soul. Nobody

16:22.600 --> 16:26.520
ever knows anything for a fact. Gazing

16:26.520 --> 16:28.580
ahead at your stooping guides, sturdy

16:28.580 --> 16:30.740
back, think that you gaze at the future,

16:30.920 --> 16:32.620
and keep your distance, if that is

16:32.620 --> 16:35.060
possible, from him. Since, in principle,

16:35.320 --> 16:37.540
life also means but a distance between

16:37.540 --> 16:39.900
here and there, and quickening the pace,

16:40.040 --> 16:42.400
pace only when you discern the sound

16:42.400 --> 16:44.660
behind of those running after you down the

16:44.660 --> 16:46.520
path, with lowered heads, be they

16:46.520 --> 16:49.740
murderers, thieves, the past. in the saw

16:49.740 --> 16:54.360
with a frogs, a frogs, in the burned down

16:54.360 --> 16:57.420
fume, prized indifference of things to

16:57.420 --> 17:00.320
being regarded from afar, and in turn lose

17:00.320 --> 17:02.280
your own silhouette, turning thus

17:02.280 --> 17:05.360
unattainable for binoculars, gendarmes,

17:05.380 --> 17:09.020
mass, coughing in a cloud of dust, wading

17:09.020 --> 17:12.780
through mud, map, what difference does it

17:12.780 --> 17:15.740
make how you would look close up, it's

17:15.740 --> 17:17.840
even better if some character with a blade

17:17.840 --> 17:21.020
figures out you're a stranger a bit too

17:21.020 --> 17:24.440
late. Rivers in Asia are longer than

17:24.440 --> 17:27.800
elsewhere, more rich in alluvium that is

17:27.800 --> 17:30.740
murkier. As you reach for a mouthful, your

17:30.740 --> 17:33.580
cupped fingers ladle sealed, and one who

17:33.580 --> 17:35.640
has drunk this water would prefer it

17:35.640 --> 17:37.940
spilled. Never trust its reflection.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.220
Crossing it, cross it on a raft built with

17:41.220 --> 17:44.200
no other hands but the pair you own. Note

17:44.200 --> 17:46.560
that the gleam of campfire, your nightly

17:46.560 --> 17:48.900
bliss, will by sliding downstream betray

17:48.900 --> 17:51.760
you to enemies. In your letters from these

17:51.760 --> 17:54.660
parts, don't divulge whom and what you've

17:54.660 --> 17:56.880
seen on your way. If anything should be

17:56.880 --> 17:58.420
penned, use your various feelings,

17:58.600 --> 18:01.500
musings, regrets at all. A letter can be

18:01.500 --> 18:04.000
intercepted and after all, the movement of

18:04.000 --> 18:07.160
a pen across paper is in itself the

18:07.160 --> 18:08.960
worsening of the break between you and

18:08.960 --> 18:11.100
those with whom you won't any longer sit

18:11.100 --> 18:13.680
or lie down with whom. unlike the letter

18:13.680 --> 18:17.320
you won't share who cares why a home when

18:17.320 --> 18:21.000
you stand on a stony on an empty stony

18:21.000 --> 18:24.740
plateau alone under the fathomless dome of

18:24.740 --> 18:28.140
Asia in whose blueness an airplane or an

18:28.140 --> 18:30.960
angel sometimes sweeps up its starch or

18:30.960 --> 18:32.880
star when you're shattered how

18:32.880 --> 18:35.020
infinitesimally small you are remember

18:35.020 --> 18:39.080
space that appears to need nothing does

18:39.080 --> 18:41.780
crave as a matter of fact an outside gaze,

18:42.220 --> 18:45.220
a criterion of emptiness, of its depth and

18:45.220 --> 18:48.180
scope, and it's only you who can do the

18:48.180 --> 18:48.560
job.

19:00.560 --> 19:06.700
The title of the next poem is

19:06.700 --> 19:08.260
a footnote to weather forecasts.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.420
A footnote to weather forecasts.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.780
A garden alley with statues of hardened

19:30.780 --> 19:35.240
mud, akin to knurled, stunted tree trunks.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.220
Some of them I knew personally, the rest I

19:40.220 --> 19:43.840
see for the first time ever. Presumably

19:43.840 --> 19:45.660
they are gods of local woods and streams,

19:46.160 --> 19:49.180
guardians of silence. As for the feminine

19:49.180 --> 19:51.540
shapes, nymphs and so forth, they look

19:51.540 --> 19:53.900
thought-like, that is unfinished, each one

19:53.900 --> 19:56.860
strives to keep, even here, in the future

19:56.860 --> 20:00.060
that came, her vagrant status. status. A

20:00.060 --> 20:02.000
cheap monk won't pop up and cross the

20:02.000 --> 20:04.980
path. No bird song is audible, nor

20:04.980 --> 20:08.460
moreover a motor. The future is a panacea

20:08.460 --> 20:11.100
against anything prone to repetition, and

20:11.100 --> 20:12.600
in the sky they're scattered like a

20:12.600 --> 20:14.880
bachelor's clothes. Clouds turned inside

20:14.880 --> 20:18.340
out, oppressed. It smells of conifer. This

20:18.340 --> 20:20.020
prickly substance of not so familiar

20:20.020 --> 20:23.740
places. Sculptures loom in the twilight,

20:23.840 --> 20:25.980
darkening thanks to the proximity to each

20:25.980 --> 20:28.240
other, thanks to the indifference of the

20:28.240 --> 20:30.960
surrounding landscape. Should any one of

20:30.960 --> 20:33.380
them speak, you would sigh, rather than

20:33.380 --> 20:36.580
gasp or shudder. Upon hearing well-known

20:36.580 --> 20:38.660
voices, hearing something like, the child

20:38.660 --> 20:41.380
wasn't yours, or true, I testified against

20:41.380 --> 20:44.120
him, but out of fear, not jealousy, petty,

20:44.320 --> 20:46.840
20-odd-year-old secrets of pure blind

20:46.840 --> 20:49.520
hearts, obsessed with a silly quest for

20:49.520 --> 20:52.480
power over their likes, the best ones

20:52.480 --> 20:55.280
among the worst ones, the executioners and

20:55.280 --> 20:57.760
the victims. It's good that someone else's

20:57.760 --> 21:00.920
memories interfere with your own. It's

21:00.920 --> 21:02.720
good that some of these figures to you

21:02.720 --> 21:06.720
appear alien. Their presence hints at

21:06.720 --> 21:09.100
different events, at a different sort of

21:09.100 --> 21:11.080
fate, perhaps not a better one, yet

21:11.080 --> 21:13.420
clearly the one that you missed. This

21:13.420 --> 21:15.620
unshackles memory more than imagination,

21:16.040 --> 21:19.180
not forever of course, but for a while, to

21:19.180 --> 21:21.120
learn that you've been deceived, It seems

21:21.120 --> 21:23.840
that you've been completely forgotten all

21:23.840 --> 21:25.840
the other way around, that you are still

21:25.840 --> 21:28.680
being hated is extremely unpleasant. But

21:28.680 --> 21:31.340
to regard yourself as the hub of even

21:31.340 --> 21:34.020
negligible universe, unbearable and

21:34.020 --> 21:38.000
indecent, a rare, perhaps the only visitor

21:38.000 --> 21:41.360
to these parts, I have, I suppose, a right

21:41.360 --> 21:44.460
to describe the observed. Here it is, our

21:44.460 --> 21:47.960
little Valhalla, our long-overgrown estate

21:47.960 --> 21:51.380
in time with a handful of mortgage souls

21:51.380 --> 21:54.120
with its meadows where sharpened sickle

21:54.120 --> 21:56.980
won't roam in all likelihood with abandon

21:56.980 --> 22:00.820
and where snowflakes float in the air as a

22:00.820 --> 22:03.320
good example of poise in a vacuum.

22:08.420 --> 22:11.400
Well, something lighter.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.560
The title of this poem is an epitaph for a

22:23.560 --> 22:26.640
centaur. You know, there's a half horse,

22:26.700 --> 22:32.860
half human creature. Richard. Epitaph for

22:32.860 --> 22:33.380
a centaur.

22:37.460 --> 22:40.760
To say that he was unhappy is either to

22:40.760 --> 22:43.860
say too much or too little, depending on

22:43.860 --> 22:46.800
who's the audience. Still, the smell he'd

22:46.800 --> 22:49.420
give off was a bit too odious, and his

22:49.420 --> 22:52.640
canter was also quite hard to match. He

22:52.640 --> 22:54.740
said they meant just a monument, but

22:54.740 --> 22:57.040
something went astray. The the womb, the

22:57.040 --> 22:59.840
assembly line, the economy, or else the

22:59.840 --> 23:02.640
war never happened. They befriended the

23:02.640 --> 23:07.460
enemy, and he was left... Well, let me

23:07.460 --> 23:09.260
start again, because it's kind of filled

23:09.260 --> 23:09.520
up.

23:12.420 --> 23:15.000
To say that he was unhappy is either to

23:15.000 --> 23:18.080
say too much or too little, depending on

23:18.080 --> 23:20.760
who's the audience. Still, the smell he'd

23:20.760 --> 23:22.400
give off was a bit too odious, and his

23:22.400 --> 23:25.700
canter was also quite hard to match. He

23:25.700 --> 23:27.800
said they meant just a monument, but

23:27.800 --> 23:30.140
something went astray. The womb, the

23:30.140 --> 23:32.840
assembly line, the economy. Where else the

23:32.840 --> 23:34.860
war never happened? They befriended the

23:34.860 --> 23:36.820
enemy, and he was left as it is,

23:36.880 --> 23:38.600
presumably to portray intransigence,

23:38.860 --> 23:41.180
incompatibility, that sort of thing which

23:41.180 --> 23:43.240
proves not so much one's uniqueness or

23:43.240 --> 23:45.880
virtue, but probability. For years,

23:45.960 --> 23:48.920
resembling a cloud, he wandered in olive

23:48.920 --> 23:52.140
groves, marveling at one-leggedness, the

23:52.140 --> 23:54.640
mother of immobility, learned to lie to

23:54.640 --> 23:57.720
himself and turned it into an art for want

23:57.720 --> 24:00.620
of a better company, also to check his

24:00.620 --> 24:03.580
sanity. And he died fairly young because

24:03.580 --> 24:05.580
his animal part turned out to be less

24:05.580 --> 24:07.140
durable than his humanity.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.780
I understand we like short and simple

24:18.780 --> 24:19.720
stuff, don't we?

24:25.720 --> 24:29.940
Okay, here's one example of that. One

24:29.940 --> 24:30.160
more.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.560
A song.

24:38.220 --> 24:42.400
I wish you were here, dear. I wish you

24:42.400 --> 24:46.520
were here. I wish you sat on the sofa and

24:46.520 --> 24:49.380
I sat near. The handkerchief could be

24:49.380 --> 24:52.440
yours. The tear could be mine, chin bound

24:52.440 --> 24:54.320
Though it could be, of course, the other

24:54.320 --> 24:57.820
way around I wish you were here, dear I

24:57.820 --> 25:01.460
wish you were here I wish we were in my

25:01.460 --> 25:04.560
car And you'd shift the gear We'd find

25:04.560 --> 25:07.920
ourselves elsewhere On an unknown shore Or

25:07.920 --> 25:09.480
else we'd repair to where we've been

25:09.480 --> 25:13.380
before I wish you were here, dear I wish

25:13.380 --> 25:16.140
you were here I wish I knew no astronomy

25:16.140 --> 25:19.540
When stars appear When the moon skims the

25:19.540 --> 25:22.340
water that sighs and shifts in its lumber.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.020
I wish it were still a quarter to dial

25:25.020 --> 25:27.780
your number. I wish you were here, dear,

25:28.040 --> 25:31.740
in this hemisphere. As I sit on the porch,

25:31.820 --> 25:35.480
sipping a beer. It's evening, the sun is

25:35.480 --> 25:38.900
setting, boys shout and girls are crying.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.560
What's the point of forgetting if it's

25:41.560 --> 25:42.340
followed by dying?

25:53.700 --> 25:56.780
The title of this poem is Lines for the

25:56.780 --> 26:01.680
Winter Recess. It's for the recess of the

26:01.680 --> 26:04.020
Congress, of the US Congress. Well, I

26:04.020 --> 26:05.660
spent indeed the last year in Washington,

26:05.960 --> 26:11.120
and here's the sort of a byproduct, if you

26:11.120 --> 26:16.260
will. Though the best, I think, outcome of

26:16.260 --> 26:18.760
a year spent in Washington in the Library

26:18.760 --> 26:21.700
of Congress was the following two-liner,

26:21.800 --> 26:24.380
of which I'm terribly proud. It goes like

26:24.380 --> 26:29.100
this. I sit at my desk. My life is

26:29.100 --> 26:29.700
grotesque.

26:34.180 --> 26:34.740
Okay.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.120
Okay.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.840
Lines for the winter recess. Well, it

26:45.840 --> 26:47.660
starts with a description, with somewhat

26:47.660 --> 26:50.160
fanciful, perhaps some of you, description

26:50.160 --> 26:52.240
of the capital in winter.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.620
A hard-boiled egg, cupped by the marble

26:59.620 --> 27:03.780
cold, cracks showing its evening yoke. The

27:03.780 --> 27:06.260
infinite avenue gobbles up cubes,

27:06.440 --> 27:09.420
rhomboids perlilipipeds, with preglacial

27:09.420 --> 27:12.600
appetite and simile in geometry. A

27:12.600 --> 27:14.580
snowbound airfield is lapping the neither

27:14.580 --> 27:17.400
milk nor honey of the meandering local

27:17.400 --> 27:20.140
river, sluggish, reluctant to make the

27:20.140 --> 27:23.180
ocean. Gentlemen, these are the good old

27:23.180 --> 27:25.960
days. Your toxic up on the highway still

27:25.960 --> 27:28.980
overtakes a hearse. A wolf flies down

27:28.980 --> 27:31.600
eagerly with a lamb or lame duck, sighting

27:31.600 --> 27:34.080
low temperature, green hues survive

27:34.080 --> 27:37.000
nevertheless in the streetlights. The mow

27:37.000 --> 27:39.900
unbundles things overseas, the richer ones

27:39.900 --> 27:42.460
cuisine, and if stocks don't shoot up any

27:42.460 --> 27:44.600
longer like obelisks, they still bear

27:44.600 --> 27:48.160
resemblance to dory columns holding a

27:48.160 --> 27:50.220
portico tight while beggars murder

27:50.220 --> 27:54.500
beggars. Lyrical and myopic stars blink in

27:54.500 --> 27:57.200
the winter sky like suburbia after hours,

27:57.440 --> 28:00.220
full of prayers sensitive to elapse in

28:00.220 --> 28:02.620
gravity but unconscious of its limits in

28:02.620 --> 28:05.680
fact quite expanding and yet the future

28:05.680 --> 28:08.620
surrounding your tender issue with

28:08.620 --> 28:11.260
bathroom tiles from onana Republic or

28:11.260 --> 28:13.640
manufactured locally is nowhere inside

28:13.640 --> 28:17.280
this are the good old days still with the

28:17.280 --> 28:19.320
quaint attractions with the unfinished

28:19.320 --> 28:22.440
business since frankly even a single swarm

28:22.440 --> 28:25.600
equals two in profile which which foils

28:25.600 --> 28:27.760
reflection if not applause, sincere

28:27.760 --> 28:31.100
window, past midnight, gleams, like a

28:31.100 --> 28:32.900
Chinaman scanning the yellow pages,

28:33.120 --> 28:35.720
stalling dreams, with their routine flat

28:35.720 --> 28:39.920
tire, with red meat curting knives, or a

28:39.920 --> 28:41.420
pasture, its herbivores.

28:44.400 --> 28:49.460
And here's something different. Well, it's

28:49.460 --> 28:53.380
a song of welcome. I should have read it

28:53.380 --> 28:57.660
at the beginning. Song of welcome.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.260
Here is your mom, here is your dad,

29:07.520 --> 29:11.820
welcome to being they flesh and blood, why

29:11.820 --> 29:14.760
do you look so sad? Here's your food,

29:14.960 --> 29:18.120
here's your drink, also some thoughts if

29:18.120 --> 29:19.800
you care to think, welcome Welcome to

29:19.800 --> 29:22.380
everything. Here's your practically clean

29:22.380 --> 29:25.020
slate. Welcome to it, though it's kind of

29:25.020 --> 29:28.560
late. Welcome at any rate. Here's your

29:28.560 --> 29:31.140
paycheck. Here's your rent. Money is

29:31.140 --> 29:33.180
nature's fifth element. Welcome to every

29:33.180 --> 29:35.900
cent. Here's your swarm and your huge

29:35.900 --> 29:39.520
beehive. Welcome to that there is roughly

29:39.520 --> 29:43.300
five billion like you alive. Welcome to

29:43.300 --> 29:44.740
the phone book that stars your name.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.940
Digits are democracy's secret aim. welcome

29:47.940 --> 29:50.700
to a claim to fame. Here's your marriage

29:50.700 --> 29:53.440
and here's divorce. Now that's the order

29:53.440 --> 29:55.620
you can't reverse, welcome to it, up

29:55.620 --> 29:58.980
yours. Here's your blade, here's your

29:58.980 --> 30:01.700
blade, here's your wrist, welcome to

30:01.700 --> 30:03.920
playing your own terrorist, call this your

30:03.920 --> 30:06.180
Middle East. Here's your mirror, your

30:06.180 --> 30:08.860
dental gleam, here's an octopus in your

30:08.860 --> 30:12.100
dream, why do you try to scream? Here's

30:12.100 --> 30:14.620
your corncob, your TV set, your Your

30:14.620 --> 30:17.320
candidate suffering and upset, welcome to

30:17.320 --> 30:20.040
what he said. Here's your porch, see the

30:20.040 --> 30:23.700
cars pass by. Here's your shitting dog's

30:23.700 --> 30:27.200
guilty eye, welcome to its alibi. Here's

30:27.200 --> 30:30.680
your cicadas, the ,, the bulbs dried tear

30:30.680 --> 30:33.380
in your lemon tea, welcome to infinity.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.260
Here are your pills on the plastic tray,

30:36.920 --> 30:40.140
your disappointing crisp x-ray, you are

30:40.140 --> 30:42.900
welcome to pray. Here's your cemetery, a

30:42.900 --> 30:45.580
well-kept glen, Welcome to a voice that

30:45.580 --> 30:49.200
says, Amen The end of the road, old man

30:49.740 --> 30:52.340
Here's your will, and here's a few takers

30:52.340 --> 30:55.720
Here's an empty pew, here's life after you

30:56.240 --> 30:58.400
And here are your stars, which appear

30:58.400 --> 31:01.260
still keen On shining as though you have

31:01.260 --> 31:03.340
never been They might have a point, old

31:03.340 --> 31:06.220
being Here's your afterlife, with no trace

31:06.220 --> 31:09.260
of you Especially of your face Welcome,

31:09.420 --> 31:11.900
and call it space Welcome to where one

31:11.900 --> 31:14.020
cannot breathe wreath. This way space

31:14.020 --> 31:17.280
resembles what's underneath and Saturn

31:17.280 --> 31:18.700
holds the wreath.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.160
I'm going to read to you a shorter poem

31:31.160 --> 31:36.800
now and I read to you both in English and

31:36.800 --> 31:46.360
in Russian if I can find... Well,

31:48.260 --> 31:52.800
it's called Breeze Marine. It's obviously,

31:52.960 --> 31:54.560
the title is obviously pinched from

31:54.560 --> 31:55.040
Mallarmé.

31:58.540 --> 32:02.720
Dear, I ventured out of the house late

32:02.720 --> 32:05.320
this this evening, merely for a breath of

32:05.320 --> 32:09.000
fresh air from the ocean not far away. The

32:09.000 --> 32:11.200
sun was smoldering low like a Chinese fan

32:11.200 --> 32:14.240
in a gallery, and a cloud reared up its

32:14.240 --> 32:17.400
huge lid like a Steinway. A quarter

32:17.400 --> 32:20.840
century back, you craved curry and dates

32:20.840 --> 32:23.120
from Senegal, tried your voice for the

32:23.120 --> 32:25.780
stage, scratched profiles in a sketch pad,

32:26.340 --> 32:29.500
dallied with me, but later, alloyed with a

32:29.500 --> 32:31.360
chemical engineer and judging by letters

32:31.360 --> 32:34.560
grew fairly stupid. These days you've been

32:34.560 --> 32:37.380
seen in churches, in the capital, and in

32:37.380 --> 32:40.200
provinces. At rights for our friends,

32:40.240 --> 32:43.400
acquaintances now continues. Yet I'm glad

32:43.400 --> 32:45.600
after all that the world still promises

32:45.600 --> 32:48.480
distances more inconceivable than the one

32:48.480 --> 32:50.840
between us. Understand me correctly

32:50.840 --> 32:53.540
though, your body, your verbal, your

32:53.540 --> 32:56.160
middle name now stir practically nothing.

32:56.460 --> 32:59.080
Not that they've ceased to burgeon, but to

32:59.080 --> 33:01.900
forget one life. A man needs at minimum

33:01.900 --> 33:04.600
one more life and I've done that portion.

33:05.100 --> 33:08.680
You got luck as well. Whales save in a

33:08.680 --> 33:11.320
snapshot perhaps. Will you forever remain

33:11.320 --> 33:14.680
free of wrinkles, lithe, caustic, vivid.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.880
Having bumped into memory, time learns

33:17.880 --> 33:21.720
impotence. Aptide, I I smoke in the

33:21.720 --> 33:24.420
darkness and inhale rank seaweed.

33:31.900 --> 33:36.000
Actually, I ruined the line here. Well, it

33:36.000 --> 33:39.220
went, having bumped into memory, time

33:39.220 --> 33:43.500
learns its impotence. For what it's worth,

33:43.640 --> 33:48.140
I repeated it. Well, the same poem is in

33:48.140 --> 33:48.480
Russian.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.780
Dear, I came out of my house late in the

33:54.780 --> 33:58.400
evening To breathe fresh air from the

33:58.400 --> 34:01.160
ocean The sunset was burning in the ground

34:01.160 --> 34:04.000
with a Chinese wind And the clouds were

34:04.000 --> 34:07.540
like a cover of a concert piano A quarter

34:07.540 --> 34:09.840
of a century ago You were eating with

34:09.840 --> 34:11.560
passion to the lullaby and to the phoenix

34:11.560 --> 34:13.960
You were drawing clouds in a notebook,

34:14.380 --> 34:17.260
singing a little You were having fun with

34:17.260 --> 34:18.460
me, but then you got together

34:46.940 --> 34:51.080
The No one destroyed them. But to forget

34:51.080 --> 34:54.240
one life, a person needs at least another

34:54.240 --> 34:57.760
life. And I lived this fate. You were

34:57.760 --> 35:01.120
lucky too. Where else, except for the

35:01.120 --> 35:04.600
photos, you will always be without

35:04.600 --> 35:08.640
wrinkles, young, cheerful, gloomy. And in

35:08.640 --> 35:11.660
time, colliding with memory, he learns

35:11.660 --> 35:14.980
about his immorality. I smoke in the dark

35:14.980 --> 35:17.740
and inhale the rot from the lily.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.220
Now you are, I'm afraid, indeed for a long

35:29.220 --> 35:31.560
haul. Well, I...

35:34.860 --> 35:38.400
It's a lengthy poem. It's titled, Fund the

35:38.400 --> 35:41.840
Circle. And...

35:47.160 --> 35:49.480
It's a lengthy poem indeed, so try to bear

35:49.480 --> 35:49.800
with me.

36:01.600 --> 36:05.620
The century will soon be over, but sooner

36:05.620 --> 36:08.720
it will be me. That's not the message

36:08.720 --> 36:11.540
though of a trembling knee, Rather the

36:11.540 --> 36:14.480
influence of not to be on to be, Of the

36:14.480 --> 36:18.140
hunter upon, so to speak, his fowl, Be

36:18.140 --> 36:20.360
that one's heart valve or a red brick

36:20.360 --> 36:23.840
wall, We hear the whiplash's fowl whistle,

36:24.520 --> 36:26.720
Recalling vainly the surnames of those who

36:26.720 --> 36:29.900
have loved us back, Writing in the

36:29.900 --> 36:33.060
slippery palms of the local quack, The

36:33.060 --> 36:35.200
world has just lost the knack of being the

36:35.200 --> 36:37.740
place where a sofa, a foxtrot, A

36:37.740 --> 36:40.640
lampshade's cream-trimming abodes, A risky

36:40.640 --> 36:43.120
utterance reigns supreme. Who could

36:43.120 --> 36:46.080
foresee time's grim eraser, Wiping them

36:46.080 --> 36:48.060
off like some chicken's crow From an old

36:48.060 --> 36:51.160
pod? Nobody, not a soul, Yet time's

36:51.160 --> 36:53.640
shuffling soul Has accomplished just that.

36:54.020 --> 36:57.480
Censurate, go ahead, Now everywhere there

36:57.480 --> 37:01.300
are antennas, Ping-pongs, stumps instead

37:01.300 --> 37:04.540
of trees. No chance of your sporting, No

37:04.540 --> 37:06.260
chance of your sporting at a little cafe,

37:06.500 --> 37:09.740
your confrere, ruined by kismet. Nor at

37:09.740 --> 37:12.240
the bar, the silk-clad angel who failed to

37:12.240 --> 37:14.600
soar above herself and her whiskey sour on

37:14.600 --> 37:16.860
ice. And all over the place, people

37:16.860 --> 37:20.140
obscure their view. Now forming a solid

37:20.140 --> 37:23.660
mass, now a lengthy queue. A tyrant's no

37:23.660 --> 37:25.700
longer a boogaboo but a plain mediocrity.

37:25.900 --> 37:28.860
Likewise, a car, at last, isn't a luxury

37:28.860 --> 37:31.200
but the means of extracting dust out of

37:31.200 --> 37:33.580
the street where the cast iron leg of a

37:33.580 --> 37:35.680
veteran fell silent for good, of course,

37:35.780 --> 37:38.520
and the child is convinced that the gray

37:38.520 --> 37:42.100
wolf is worse than infantry or the Air

37:42.100 --> 37:46.220
Force. And somehow, your hanky, bypassing

37:46.220 --> 37:48.480
your nose more and more often, leaps to

37:48.480 --> 37:50.880
your organ of sight, trained on rustling

37:50.880 --> 37:53.340
leaves, taking personally the least new

37:53.340 --> 37:56.500
gap in the emptiness shielding fence, the

37:56.500 --> 37:59.720
letters E.D. heralding the past tense, an

37:59.720 --> 38:02.600
area of suspense sung by a cuckoo's voice.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.480
Now it sounds more crude than sake of

38:05.480 --> 38:09.180
rhodosis, approximately like, hey dude, or

38:09.180 --> 38:11.220
at best like, you should quit drinking,

38:11.420 --> 38:13.940
and your limp palm glides over the

38:13.940 --> 38:16.140
decanter's skin. Though it's neither the

38:16.140 --> 38:18.560
priest nor the rabbi that's barging in but

38:18.560 --> 38:21.500
the air called from the circle. Black

38:21.500 --> 38:24.240
things are in vogue, camisoles, bloomers,

38:24.340 --> 38:27.100
hoes. When in the end you relieve your

38:27.100 --> 38:29.420
playmate of those items, your humble house

38:29.420 --> 38:32.660
suddenly gets lit up by something like 20

38:32.660 --> 38:35.900
watts. But instead of an exuberant vivat,

38:36.100 --> 38:38.780
the leaves drop a flat sorry. New times,

38:39.020 --> 38:43.280
lamentable sorry times. Goods in shop

38:43.280 --> 38:46.440
windows, spurting nicknames, entice us

38:46.440 --> 38:48.660
into telling the types of things which are

38:48.660 --> 38:51.040
managed easily from the kinds which we,

38:51.160 --> 38:54.220
technologically behind, now equate to

38:54.220 --> 38:56.400
mankind's ancient quest, not so much for

38:56.400 --> 38:59.360
something that lets you save energy as for

38:59.360 --> 39:02.360
an inanimate sort of slave on the whole

39:02.360 --> 39:05.220
for safe anonymity. That's the logical,

39:05.320 --> 39:08.300
though unwelcome end of multiplying, of

39:08.300 --> 39:10.560
the demographic trend who sources neither

39:10.560 --> 39:12.940
the Orient nor zippers but electricity.

39:13.740 --> 39:16.380
The centuries winding down the rush of

39:16.380 --> 39:21.400
time demanding a ruin, a victim rejects

39:21.400 --> 39:24.380
his trash bag and a man won't wash either.

39:24.380 --> 39:27.580
No, give it sentiments, give it ideas,

39:27.760 --> 39:30.360
plus memories, such as times our last

39:30.360 --> 39:33.180
sweet tooth. Well, I make no fuss and

39:33.180 --> 39:36.040
give. I am not yellow. I am ready to play

39:36.040 --> 39:37.940
a thing of the past, if that's so

39:37.940 --> 39:40.580
interesting to time, eyeing absentmindedly

39:40.580 --> 39:43.480
over its shoulder its measly catch, which

39:43.480 --> 39:45.420
still shows some movement, though not much

39:45.420 --> 39:48.020
else, and is still warm to touch. I am

39:48.020 --> 39:50.620
ready to sing for good in them shifting

39:50.620 --> 39:53.840
sands and I am prepared for the traveler,

39:53.840 --> 39:57.140
shambling by won't focus the BDI of his

39:57.140 --> 40:00.040
camera on me and that he won't succumb to

40:00.040 --> 40:02.620
some powerful feeling on my account. It so

40:02.620 --> 40:05.560
happens I can't stand, I can't stand time

40:05.560 --> 40:08.540
that moves on, time that stands still, I

40:08.540 --> 40:10.780
still can't stand like a solid facade

40:10.780 --> 40:13.620
whose style echoes now a stockpile, now a

40:13.620 --> 40:16.720
chessboard. The century was indeed not so

40:16.720 --> 40:19.420
bad. Well, perhaps the dead run a surplus,

40:19.680 --> 40:22.060
yet the living did did just that as well,

40:22.240 --> 40:25.560
so substantially, in fact, that presently

40:25.560 --> 40:27.120
they could be pickled, packed, and sealed

40:27.120 --> 40:29.320
to attract stellar customers known for

40:29.320 --> 40:31.500
their grand deep-freeze machinery, unless,

40:31.580 --> 40:33.360
of course, they insist on cheese, which

40:33.360 --> 40:35.620
could be vesicle, is arranged, the holes

40:35.620 --> 40:37.980
in the collective memory are the proof, to

40:37.980 --> 40:40.100
the accompaniment of air crushes in not

40:40.100 --> 40:43.880
far off spots, the century ends, a prof

40:43.880 --> 40:46.940
mumbles, poking his finger upward about

40:46.940 --> 40:49.380
the atmosphere's layers, expanding the

40:49.380 --> 40:51.560
heat, explaining the heat and attendant

40:51.560 --> 40:56.300
fears, but not how one steers from here to

40:56.300 --> 40:59.160
where the cumulus bulky front is suffused

40:59.160 --> 41:01.440
with our forgive and don't forsake me,

41:01.540 --> 41:04.400
which don't the ray interchanging its gold

41:04.400 --> 41:07.400
into some silver row. Yet the century,

41:07.660 --> 41:10.180
rummaging through its bureau, treats as

41:10.180 --> 41:14.080
retro even that. Well, small wonder, the

41:14.080 --> 41:17.060
more it ticks and tocks, the busier young

41:17.060 --> 41:19.620
dicks, the more the antiques and relics

41:19.620 --> 41:22.440
including the planet stuck in its orbit

41:22.440 --> 41:25.100
and curting a sitting duck the runaway

41:25.100 --> 41:27.220
called the suck of a comet including the

41:27.220 --> 41:30.440
dog ear files of the fallen giant since

41:30.440 --> 41:32.640
every bullet flies from the future which

41:32.640 --> 41:34.880
plies its urgent trade with the present

41:34.880 --> 41:38.060
and thus needs room now therefore no

41:38.700 --> 41:41.320
heirloom lasts in the doory of bloom for

41:41.320 --> 41:44.380
long at the north pole at the North Pole,

41:44.560 --> 41:47.200
a husky barks, and a flock still twists.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.180
In the west, they stare eastward, through

41:50.180 --> 41:53.140
their clenched fists, making out at least

41:53.140 --> 41:56.260
some barks, gone suddenly lively, spooked

41:56.260 --> 41:58.780
by the forest of hands. Birds, too,

41:58.900 --> 42:00.980
flutter and then take wing rapidly,

42:01.220 --> 42:05.000
heading due south to its valleys, to its

42:05.000 --> 42:07.860
minarets, turbans, palm trees, and further

42:07.860 --> 42:11.440
down, tom-tom row, row, tom-toms row, but

42:11.440 --> 42:13.960
the longer you scan strange features, the

42:13.960 --> 42:16.300
more they go you. You conclude that all

42:16.300 --> 42:19.000
over the place the kinship between plain

42:19.000 --> 42:22.320
old dirt and, say, a great painting of the

42:22.320 --> 42:24.580
classical sword lies, and that you won't

42:24.580 --> 42:28.060
hurt either's original ever. That nature,

42:28.200 --> 42:31.400
like minstrels of yesteryear longing for

42:31.400 --> 42:33.480
carbons, like thalamus holding holding

42:33.480 --> 42:35.960
dear black letters like a honeybee near

42:35.960 --> 42:38.620
its hive, truly cherishes the mass scale,

42:38.960 --> 42:42.080
profuse outputs, dreading uniqueness for

42:42.080 --> 42:44.480
its abuse of energy, whose best guardian

42:44.480 --> 42:47.800
is licentiousness. Space is fully settled.

42:48.420 --> 42:52.520
Time is welcome to rub against its new

42:52.520 --> 42:56.360
surface. I'm sure space is fully settled.

42:56.660 --> 42:59.160
Time is welcome to rub against its new

42:59.160 --> 43:01.700
surface. I'm sure indefinitely. All the

43:01.700 --> 43:05.080
same your eyelid is drooping only the seas

43:05.080 --> 43:08.960
alone Remain unruffled and blue telling

43:08.960 --> 43:13.020
the dome go on Which sounds from afar like

43:13.020 --> 43:16.320
gone and upon hearing that one wants to

43:16.320 --> 43:19.920
quit one's travail Shoveling digging and

43:19.920 --> 43:22.720
board a steamship and sail and sail in

43:22.720 --> 43:25.740
order to hail in the end not an island Not

43:25.740 --> 43:28.520
an organism Linnaeus never found not the

43:28.520 --> 43:30.860
charms of new latitudes but the other way

43:30.860 --> 43:33.400
around, something of no account.

43:44.460 --> 43:47.640
Let me see what else is here. Something

43:47.640 --> 43:48.060
short.

44:07.940 --> 44:11.900
It's a bit early for this poem.

44:23.340 --> 44:27.240
It's a very simple poem. it's the Star of

44:27.240 --> 44:31.260
Nativity in

44:31.260 --> 44:35.440
the cold season in the locality accustomed

44:35.440 --> 44:38.080
to heat more than to cold the

44:38.080 --> 44:40.680
horizontality more than to a mountain a

44:40.680 --> 44:43.640
child was born in a cave in order to save

44:43.640 --> 44:47.180
the world it blew as only in deserts in

44:47.180 --> 44:50.860
the winter it blows athwart to him all

44:50.860 --> 44:53.380
things seemed enormous enormous his

44:53.380 --> 44:56.120
mother's breast, the steam out of the ox's

44:56.120 --> 44:59.240
nostrils, Kaspar, Baltazar, Melchior, the

44:59.240 --> 45:02.020
team of Magi, their presence heaped by the

45:02.020 --> 45:06.020
door, ajar. He was but a dot, and a dot

45:06.020 --> 45:09.120
was the star, keenly, without blinking,

45:09.480 --> 45:12.620
through pallid, stray clouds, upon a child

45:12.620 --> 45:15.840
in the manger, from far away, from the

45:15.840 --> 45:18.040
depth of the universe, from its opposite

45:18.040 --> 45:20.700
end, the star was looking into the cave,

45:20.860 --> 45:23.120
and that was the Father's Stare.

45:52.100 --> 45:55.740
оказалось огромным грудь матери желтый пар

45:55.740 --> 45:59.200
из воровьих ноздрей волхвы болтозар

45:59.200 --> 46:03.000
господь мельхиор их подарки втащенные сюда

46:03.000 --> 46:06.960
он был всего лишь точкой и точкой было

46:06.960 --> 46:11.880
звезда внимательно не мигая сквозь редкие

46:11.880 --> 46:15.580
облака на лежащего в яслях ребенка

46:15.580 --> 46:18.820
издалека из глубины вселенной

46:32.380 --> 46:33.000
Well,

46:36.460 --> 46:39.560
I'm going to read to you two more poems.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.280
poems. Oh, well, I'm going to read you one

46:43.280 --> 46:44.900
more, well, several more poems.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.780
Now I think you've just played enough

46:51.780 --> 46:53.860
equations and you deserve to be

46:53.860 --> 46:54.220
entertained.

46:59.040 --> 47:03.380
Okay. Well, this This is what you're going

47:03.380 --> 47:06.700
to hear is essentially a translation.

47:10.380 --> 47:14.660
I translated this poem into English from,

47:14.720 --> 47:17.700
believe it or not, from a Sumerian

47:17.700 --> 47:19.360
language, from Akkadian to be precise.
