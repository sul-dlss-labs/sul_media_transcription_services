00:04.600 --> 00:07.360
David Shainberg Reviewer 1 Dates back to

00:07.360 --> 00:13.040
the 11th or 10th century BC. And it's

00:13.040 --> 00:15.220
known among Sumerian scholars as dialogue

00:15.220 --> 00:19.500
on pessimism. Well, that's one set of

00:19.500 --> 00:23.380
scholars think of this poem as a dialogue

00:23.380 --> 00:25.820
on pessimism. The other set of scholars,

00:26.060 --> 00:31.220
presumably now as numerous, claims that

00:31.220 --> 00:33.200
it's being sort of a theatrical skit.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.580
Well, you will decide yourself what it is.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.160
If you can help it in the course of my

00:40.160 --> 00:42.520
reading it to you, don't just laugh. Don't

00:42.520 --> 00:43.200
laugh so readily.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.100
Well, it's about two pages, basically.

00:55.940 --> 01:01.220
slave come slave come to my service slave

01:01.220 --> 01:04.640
come to my service yes my master yes quick

01:10.520 --> 01:12.680

01:12.680 --> 01:15.200
the king will be pleased to see you he

01:15.200 --> 01:18.100
will be benevolent to you no slave i won't

01:18.100 --> 01:20.340
go go to the palace. Don't, my master,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.140
don't go to the palace. The king will send

01:23.140 --> 01:25.320
you on a faraway expedition down the

01:25.320 --> 01:27.540
unknown road through hostile mountains.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.580
Day and night he will make you experience

01:29.580 --> 01:32.540
pain and hardship. Slave, come to my

01:32.540 --> 01:35.820
service. Yes, my master, yes. Fetch water,

01:36.140 --> 01:38.240
pour it over my hands. I am to eat my

01:38.240 --> 01:40.920
supper. Eat your supper, my master, eat

01:40.920 --> 01:43.320
your supper. Frequent meals glutton one's

01:43.320 --> 01:45.560
heart. Man's supper is the supper of his

01:45.560 --> 01:47.820
God and clean hands catch the eye of

01:47.820 --> 01:50.660
Shamash. No slave, I won't eat my supper.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.120
Don't eat your supper, master. Don't eat

01:53.120 --> 01:55.380
your supper. Drink and thirst, food and

01:55.380 --> 01:57.460
hunger. Never leave men alone that alone

01:57.460 --> 02:00.140
each other. Slave, come to my service.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.640
Yes, my master, yes. Quick, fetch my

02:02.640 --> 02:04.440
chariot, hitch up the horses. I'll go for

02:04.440 --> 02:06.580
a ride in the country. Do that, my master,

02:06.680 --> 02:09.080
do that. A carefree wanderer always feels

02:09.080 --> 02:11.980
his belly. A stray dog always finds a

02:11.980 --> 02:14.080
bone. A migrating swallow is especially

02:14.080 --> 02:16.520
skilled in nesting. A wild donkey finds

02:16.520 --> 02:19.020
the grass in the driest desert. No slave,

02:19.240 --> 02:20.840
I won't go for a ride in the country.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.200
Don't go, my master, don't bother. The lot

02:24.200 --> 02:27.080
of a wanderer is always dicey. A stray dog

02:27.080 --> 02:29.180
loses its teeth. The nest of a migrating

02:29.180 --> 02:31.780
swallow gets buried in plaster. Naked

02:31.780 --> 02:34.520
earth is a wild donkey's bedding. Slave,

02:34.720 --> 02:37.840
come to my service. Yes, my master, yes. I

02:37.840 --> 02:39.220
feel like starting a family, like

02:39.220 --> 02:41.260
begetting children good thinking my master

02:41.260 --> 02:44.580

02:44.580 --> 02:46.460

02:46.460 --> 02:49.380
posthumous prayers no slave I won't start

02:49.380 --> 02:52.240
a family I won't have children don't start

02:52.240 --> 02:55.260
at my master don't have them a family is

02:55.260 --> 02:58.120
like a broken door is hinges creaking only

02:58.120 --> 03:00.360
a third of a once children are healthy two

03:00.360 --> 03:02.500
-thirds always sickly so should I start a

03:02.500 --> 03:05.220
family don't start a family who starts a

03:05.220 --> 03:08.140
family waste his ancestral house slave

03:08.140 --> 03:11.880
come to my service yes my master yes i

03:11.880 --> 03:13.880
shall deal to my enemy in the court i will

03:13.880 --> 03:16.480
still silent before my detractors right my

03:16.480 --> 03:19.240

03:21.240 --> 03:23.340
slave i won't be silent and i won't yield

03:23.340 --> 03:25.940
don't heal my master and don't be silent

03:25.940 --> 03:28.180
even if you don't open your mouth at all

03:28.180 --> 03:30.200
your enemies will be merciless and cruel

03:30.200 --> 03:33.500
to you as well as numerous slave come to

03:33.500 --> 03:37.620
my service yes my master yes I feel looked

03:37.620 --> 03:40.520
like doing some evil and do that my master

03:40.520 --> 03:42.860
by all means do some evil for how

03:42.860 --> 03:44.760
otherwise can you stuff your belly how

03:44.760 --> 03:47.060
without doing evil you can you dress

03:47.060 --> 03:49.360
yourself warmly no slave I shall do no

03:49.360 --> 03:51.880
evil evil doers I either killed of laid

03:51.880 --> 03:54.220
alive and blinded or blind and inflate

03:54.220 --> 03:56.640
alive and thrown into a dungeon slave come

03:56.640 --> 04:00.020
to my service Yes, my master, yes. I'll

04:00.020 --> 04:01.820
fall in love with a woman. Fall in love

04:01.820 --> 04:04.480
with my master. Fall in love. Who falls in

04:04.480 --> 04:06.140
love with a woman forgets his griefs and

04:06.140 --> 04:08.660
sorrows. No slave. I won't fall in love

04:08.660 --> 04:11.580
with a woman. Don't love, my master. Don't

04:11.580 --> 04:14.360
love. Woman is a snare, a trap, a dark

04:14.360 --> 04:16.740
pit. Woman is a sharp steel blade slitting

04:16.740 --> 04:19.620
man's throat in darkness. Slave, come to

04:19.620 --> 04:22.840
my service. Yes, my master, yes. Quick

04:22.840 --> 04:25.900
fetch water to wash my hands. I am to make

04:25.900 --> 04:28.000
an offering to my God. Make an offering.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.480
Make an offering. Who makes offering to

04:30.480 --> 04:32.860
his God fills his heart with riches. He

04:32.860 --> 04:35.800
feels generous and his purse is open. No

04:35.800 --> 04:38.500
slave. I won't make an offering. Rightly

04:38.500 --> 04:41.140
so, my master. Rightly so. Can you really

04:41.140 --> 04:42.680
train your God to follow you like a

04:42.680 --> 04:45.240
doggie? All the time he demands obedience,

04:45.500 --> 04:48.900
retail, sacrifices. Slave, come to my

04:48.900 --> 04:51.720
service. Yes, my master, yes. I will

04:51.720 --> 04:53.880
invest with interest. I will loan for the

04:53.880 --> 04:56.180
interest. Yes, invest with interest, make

04:56.180 --> 04:57.920
loans for the interest. Who does,

04:58.060 --> 04:59.880
preserves his own, his profit though is

04:59.880 --> 05:02.760
enormous, is enormous. No slave, I won't

05:02.760 --> 05:05.000
lend and I won't invest. Don't invest, my

05:05.000 --> 05:07.840
master, don't lend. To lend is like loving

05:07.840 --> 05:09.720
a woman, to receive like siring but

05:09.720 --> 05:12.040
children. People always curse those whose

05:12.040 --> 05:15.320
grain they eat. They resent you and try to

05:15.320 --> 05:17.800
reduce your profit. Slave, come to my

05:17.800 --> 05:21.700
service. Yes, my master, yes. I shall do a

05:21.700 --> 05:23.540
good deed for my nation. Very good, my

05:23.540 --> 05:25.780
master, very good. You do that. Who does

05:25.780 --> 05:27.640
good deeds for his nation has his name in

05:27.640 --> 05:31.400
Marduk's gold signet. No slave. I won't do

05:31.400 --> 05:33.480
a good deed for my nation. Don't do that,

05:33.500 --> 05:36.300
my master. Don't bother. Get up and stroll

05:36.300 --> 05:38.960
across ancient ruins. scant the skulls of

05:38.960 --> 05:41.380
simple folk and nobles. Which one of them

05:41.380 --> 05:43.600
was a villain? Which one? A benefactor?

05:44.200 --> 05:46.860
Slave, come to my service. Yes, my master,

05:46.920 --> 05:51.580
yes. If all this is so, then what is good?

05:52.520 --> 05:55.940
To have your neck broken and my neck

05:55.940 --> 05:58.640
broken, to be thrown into a river, that's

05:58.640 --> 06:01.140
what is good. Who is so tall as to reach

06:01.140 --> 06:03.760
the heavens? Who is so broad as to embrace

06:03.760 --> 06:06.120
plains and mountains? mountains. If that's

06:06.120 --> 06:08.260
so, I should kill your slave. I'd rather

06:08.260 --> 06:11.120
you go before me. And does my master

06:11.120 --> 06:13.060
believe that he can survive for three days

06:13.060 --> 06:15.780
without me?"

06:26.220 --> 06:27.980
Well, and just one more poem.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.700
Well, why don't I do this?

06:46.100 --> 06:48.540
The title of this poem is New Life.

06:52.820 --> 06:55.360
And reading it constitutes a world

06:55.360 --> 06:56.620
premiere for this poem.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.480
I'll try to go as slowly as possible about

07:05.480 --> 07:09.380
the lines. New life.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.620
Imagine that war is over, that peace has

07:17.620 --> 07:21.540
resumed its reign, that you can still make

07:21.540 --> 07:24.840
a mirror, that it's a cuckoo or a magpie

07:24.840 --> 07:28.020
and not the junkers that chirps in the

07:28.020 --> 07:30.860
twigs again. That the window frames not

07:30.860 --> 07:32.800
the town's rubble but its rococo palms,

07:33.040 --> 07:36.020
magnolias, pine trees, tenacious ivy,

07:36.020 --> 07:39.260
grass, laurel. That the cast iron lace the

07:39.260 --> 07:42.020
moon used to shepherd clouds in endured in

07:42.020 --> 07:45.200
the end the onslaught of mimosa plus burst

07:45.200 --> 07:47.880
of agave. That life must start from the

07:47.880 --> 07:51.140
very threshold. People exit their rooms

07:51.140 --> 07:54.340
whose chairs like letters B or else H,

07:54.700 --> 07:58.240
shield them from vertigo on occasion. They

07:58.240 --> 07:59.980
have used to nobody save themselves

07:59.980 --> 08:02.620
pavement flagstones, the rules of

08:02.620 --> 08:05.160
multiplication. Thus the impact of

08:05.160 --> 08:07.320
statues, of the empty niches more

08:07.320 --> 08:10.560
accurately. Well, failing sanctity one

08:10.560 --> 08:13.520
still can use is by word. Imagine that

08:13.520 --> 08:16.660
this is all true. Imagine you speak of

08:16.660 --> 08:18.860
yourself while speaking of them of

08:18.860 --> 08:21.860
anything extra, side word. Life Life

08:21.860 --> 08:24.460
starts in you indeed like this, with a

08:24.460 --> 08:27.580
painted view of a volcanic eruption, of a

08:27.580 --> 08:30.520
dinghy high wave's billiger, with that

08:30.520 --> 08:32.140
attendant feeling it's only you who

08:32.140 --> 08:34.500
surveyed the disaster, with the feeling

08:34.500 --> 08:36.280
that you are eager to shift your gaze any

08:36.280 --> 08:39.260
moment, catch sight of a couch, a blast of

08:39.260 --> 08:42.240
peonies in Chinese ways, sallow against

08:42.240 --> 08:45.900
the plaster. They garish colors, they

08:45.900 --> 08:48.300
wilting mouths, must be in their turn

08:48.300 --> 08:51.320
harbingers of a disaster. Each thing is

08:51.320 --> 08:53.820
vulnerable. The very thought about the

08:53.820 --> 08:55.860
thing gets quickly forgotten. Things are

08:55.860 --> 08:59.200
in truth the leeches of thought. Hence

08:59.200 --> 09:01.720
their shapes. Each one is a brain cut out.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.500
The attachment to place. The Penelope

09:05.500 --> 09:07.980
features that is taste for the future. At

09:07.980 --> 09:11.160
sunrise a rooster is heard. Stepping out

09:11.160 --> 09:13.200
of the tub, wrapped in the bed sheets,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.860
leaning in a hotel. In the new life you

09:15.860 --> 09:18.140
learn the the herd of four-legged

09:18.140 --> 09:20.500
furniture, mahogany, and cast iron.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.320
Imagine that epics shrink into idylls,

09:24.320 --> 09:27.060
that words about the converse of flames,

09:27.160 --> 09:30.620
long tongues, of that raging sermon which

09:30.620 --> 09:32.680
used to devour your betters greedily like

09:32.680 --> 09:36.280
dry wood, that flame found it difficult to

09:36.280 --> 09:38.280
determine your worth, not to mention

09:38.280 --> 09:40.820
warmth. That's why you've survived intact.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.040
That's why you can stomach apathy. That's

09:44.040 --> 09:46.060
why you feel fit to mingle with Pomona,

09:46.060 --> 09:48.440
Vertumni, Ceres, this place is packed

09:48.440 --> 09:51.020
with. That's why on your lips is this

09:51.020 --> 09:54.100
shepherd's jingle. For how long can one

09:54.100 --> 09:57.900
justify oneself? However you hide the ace,

09:58.120 --> 10:01.060
the table gets hit with jacks of some old

10:01.060 --> 10:05.000
suit or tailor. Imagine the more sincere

10:05.000 --> 10:07.740
the voice, the less it retains the trace

10:07.740 --> 10:10.500
of love for no matter what, of anger, of

10:10.500 --> 10:13.540
tears, of terror. Imagine your wireless

10:13.540 --> 10:17.300
catching at times your old anthems hum.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.480
Imagine that here too each letter is

10:20.480 --> 10:23.240
trailed by a weaning retinue of its likes,

10:23.440 --> 10:26.300
forming blindly now Betsy, now Ibrahim,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.920
dragging the pen past the limits of

10:28.920 --> 10:31.860
alphabet and meaning. Twilight in the the

10:31.860 --> 10:37.060
new life, cicadas that don't relent, a

10:37.060 --> 10:40.080
classicist perspective that lacks a tank

10:40.080 --> 10:43.080
or burying that dank fog patches to

10:43.080 --> 10:46.200
obfuscate its end, a bare parquet floor

10:46.200 --> 10:49.700
that never sustained a tango. In the new

10:49.700 --> 10:52.060
life they don't beg the moment, stay,

10:52.420 --> 10:55.000
brought to a standstill, it quickly

10:55.000 --> 10:57.980
succumbs to dotage, and your features on

10:57.980 --> 11:00.040
top of that are glazed enough anyway to

11:00.040 --> 11:03.120
scratch on their mat side high and attach

11:03.120 --> 11:07.080
the postage. The white stuccoed walls of a

11:07.080 --> 11:11.760
room are turning more white because of a

11:11.760 --> 11:14.880
glance shot in their direction and boding

11:14.880 --> 11:17.540
censure, steep not so much in great

11:17.540 --> 11:20.320
meadows' morose repose as in the

11:20.320 --> 11:22.380
spectrum's lack of their self-negating

11:22.380 --> 11:25.180
tincture. A thing can be pardoned plenty,

11:25.560 --> 11:28.480
especially when it comes, zones, where it

11:28.480 --> 11:31.560
reaches its end, ultimately one's unbound

11:31.560 --> 11:34.740
curiosity about these empty zones, about

11:34.740 --> 11:37.860
this objectless vista is what art seems to

11:37.860 --> 11:40.920
be all about. In the new life, a cloud is

11:40.920 --> 11:44.500
better than the bright sun. The rain, akin

11:44.500 --> 11:47.500
to self-knowledge, appears perpetual. On

11:47.500 --> 11:50.140
the other hand, an unexpected train you

11:50.140 --> 11:51.840
don't wait for alone on the platform

11:51.840 --> 11:55.340
arrives on schedule. A sail is passing its

11:55.340 --> 11:59.140
judgment on the horizon's lie. The eye

11:59.140 --> 12:00.980
tracks the sleeping self, though it's the

12:00.980 --> 12:04.280
foam that's famous. And should anyone ask

12:04.280 --> 12:08.260
you, who are you? You reply, who? I? I am

12:08.260 --> 12:10.960
nobody, as Ulysses once muttered to

12:10.960 --> 12:11.560
Polyphemus.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.740
That's an old poem. Okay, I'll do that.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.900
I was asked to read you one more poem.

12:44.980 --> 12:47.060
It's an old poem indeed, and if I can find

12:47.060 --> 12:48.080
it, I'll read it to you.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.820
Well, let me see. Maybe I should look at

12:58.820 --> 12:59.540
the table of comments.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.620
Charles Junkerman from Humanity Center

13:19.620 --> 13:22.280
asked me to read this poem and I can't

13:22.280 --> 13:25.080
deny my host.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.980
The title of this poem is, it's an old

13:31.980 --> 13:35.880
poem, it's about 20 years ago, it's called

13:35.880 --> 13:37.100
Odysseus to Telemachus.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.260
My dear Telemachus, the Trojan War is over

13:45.260 --> 13:48.760
now. I don't recall who won it, the Greeks

13:48.760 --> 13:51.680
no doubt, for only they would leave so

13:51.680 --> 13:53.940
many dead so far from their own homeland.

13:54.440 --> 13:58.300
But still, my homeward way has proved too

13:58.300 --> 14:00.940
long. While we were wasting time there,

14:01.120 --> 14:03.840
old Poseidon, it almost seems, stretched

14:03.840 --> 14:07.640
an extended space. I don't know where I am

14:07.640 --> 14:10.740
or what this place can be. It would appear

14:10.740 --> 14:13.300
some filthy island with bushes, buildings

14:13.300 --> 14:15.600
and great grunting hunting pigs, a garden

14:15.600 --> 14:18.300
choked with weeds, some queen or other,

14:18.440 --> 14:22.540
grass and huge stones. Telemachus, my son,

14:23.360 --> 14:25.340
to wander the faces of all islands

14:25.340 --> 14:28.540
resemble one another and the mind trips

14:28.540 --> 14:31.780
numbering waves, eyes soar from sea

14:31.780 --> 14:34.680
horizons, run and the flesh of water

14:34.680 --> 14:38.280
stuffs the ears. I can't remember how the

14:38.280 --> 14:41.480
war came out, even how old you are, I

14:41.480 --> 14:44.120
can't remember. Remember, grow up then, my

14:44.120 --> 14:47.560
Telemachus, grow strong. Only the gods

14:47.560 --> 14:49.840
know if we'll see each other again. You've

14:49.840 --> 14:52.280
long since ceased to be that babe before

14:52.280 --> 14:55.100
whom I reined in the plowing bullocks. Had

14:55.100 --> 14:58.960
it not been for Palamedes' trick, we two

14:58.960 --> 15:01.000
would still be living in one household.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.400
But maybe he was right. Away from me. You

15:05.400 --> 15:07.680
are quite safe from all Oedipal passions.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.960
And your dreams, my Telemachus, are

15:10.960 --> 15:11.480
blameless.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.760
Okay, I read this poem in Russian.

15:34.180 --> 15:41.340
odyssey telemark my telemark Trojan war is

15:41.340 --> 15:46.240
over who won I don't remember there must

15:46.240 --> 15:49.540
be Greeks so many dead people can't be

15:49.540 --> 15:53.880
thrown away only Greeks can and still the

15:53.880 --> 15:57.600
host home the road The road seemed too

15:57.600 --> 16:01.200
long, like Poseidon While we were there,

16:01.400 --> 16:05.780
we lost time, stretched the space I don't

16:05.780 --> 16:09.120
know where I am, what's in front of me

16:09.120 --> 16:12.840
Some dirty island, bushes, buildings,

16:13.400 --> 16:16.980
growling of pigs A overgrown garden, some

16:16.980 --> 16:20.980
kind of queen, grass to the stones A cute

16:20.980 --> 16:23.940
telemark, all the islands look like each

16:23.940 --> 16:32.860
other a young manter

16:32.860 --> 16:33.100
from

16:36.300 --> 16:40.540
me I don't remember how the war ended And

16:40.540 --> 16:44.360
how old you are now I don't remember Grow

16:44.360 --> 16:49.420
up, my big telemark, grow up Only the gods

16:49.420 --> 16:53.420
know Will we meet again You are no longer

16:53.420 --> 16:57.000
the same young man Before whom I held the

16:57.000 --> 16:59.820
bulls Like a long-lived palm tree We lived

16:59.820 --> 17:04.100
together But maybe he's right Without me

17:04.100 --> 17:06.320
you are saved from the passions of the

17:06.320 --> 17:11.360
Oedipus, and your dreams, my telemark, are

17:11.360 --> 17:11.480
flawless.

17:37.620 --> 17:38.700
Thank you very much.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.720
Thank you very much. You appear to be very

17:55.720 --> 18:00.580
patient people. Thank you. Thank you.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.660
Thank you.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.340
Thank you.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.320
Thank you.

20:11.620 --> 20:11.680
Thank you.
