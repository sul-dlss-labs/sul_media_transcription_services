00:16.940 --> 00:21.580
All right. Welcome to CS547. I've just got

00:21.580 --> 00:25.200
a few words of administrative stuff. The

00:25.200 --> 00:27.320
official sign-in list is right here. It

00:27.320 --> 00:28.700
should have everyone's name on it who was

00:28.700 --> 00:30.680
here last time. Just give your signature

00:30.680 --> 00:32.820
next to it, and that should be enough. If

00:32.820 --> 00:34.340
you're not on the list, just put your name

00:34.340 --> 00:35.980
at the end. And we've also had some

00:35.980 --> 00:39.160
problems in the past with the list sort of

00:39.160 --> 00:41.060
being stuck over here. So if you're

00:41.060 --> 00:42.320
holding the list over here and it's not

00:42.320 --> 00:43.960
going anywhere, make sure it gets over

00:43.960 --> 00:46.040
there because that seems to be a perpetual

00:46.040 --> 00:50.020
problem. And subbing for today is Karen

00:50.020 --> 00:51.180
Butler, and she's going to give an

00:51.180 --> 00:55.480
introduction. Yes, I'm substituting for

00:55.480 --> 00:58.100
Professor Winograd today. and I just

00:58.100 --> 01:00.680
wanted to briefly introduce our speaker

01:00.680 --> 01:06.120
for today. Lucy Suchman was one of the

01:06.120 --> 01:08.520
first to apply anthropology to the whole

01:08.520 --> 01:12.600
area of human-computer interaction. She is

01:12.600 --> 01:15.300
the author of Plans and Situated Actions,

01:15.360 --> 01:16.880
which came out of her dissertation work.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.500
and she has been working at Xerox PARC for

01:20.500 --> 01:25.660
several years where she's head of the is

01:25.660 --> 01:29.220
it product work practices area and where

01:29.220 --> 01:31.080
she's really an expert in work patterns

01:31.080 --> 01:32.620
and applying this whole area so she's

01:32.620 --> 01:34.260
going to be speaking us to us today about

01:34.260 --> 01:37.760
some of her work in this area thank you

01:46.880 --> 01:47.000
OK.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.880
Oh, it's the left-right problem, I see.

02:05.300 --> 02:09.340
I have to reverse the little clip.

02:21.640 --> 02:25.480
Okay, is that as it's supposed to be as

02:25.480 --> 02:30.400
far as you can tell? Okay, my talk today

02:30.400 --> 02:33.860
is, the title is Putting Working Document

02:33.860 --> 02:36.440
Collections Online, and I'm going to use a

02:36.440 --> 02:38.780
current project that I'm involved with as

02:38.780 --> 02:42.280
a kind of illustration of the work that I

02:42.280 --> 02:44.820
and my colleagues at Xerox PARC have been

02:44.820 --> 02:47.620
doing, and this is very much a joint

02:47.620 --> 02:50.420
project with my colleagues Jeanette

02:50.420 --> 02:52.520
Blomberg, who's also an anthropologist,

02:53.180 --> 02:55.500
Randy Trigg, who's a computer scientist,

02:55.720 --> 02:57.020
and David Levy, who's a computer

02:57.020 --> 02:59.400
scientist. So this is a thoroughly

02:59.400 --> 03:02.500
collaborative effort that I'm presenting

03:02.500 --> 03:06.180
to you today. And as you'll see, the title

03:06.180 --> 03:08.120
is Putting Working Document Collections

03:08.120 --> 03:11.040
Online. That's sort of the more general

03:11.040 --> 03:13.240
project, and then the more specific

03:13.240 --> 03:14.680
instance of it that I'm going to be

03:14.680 --> 03:17.000
talking about is located in a particular

03:17.000 --> 03:20.020
organization, namely our beloved State

03:20.020 --> 03:22.380
Department of Transportation, Caltrans.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.200
And you'll hear a lot more about that as I

03:27.200 --> 03:32.760
go along. I wanted to start out by showing

03:32.760 --> 03:36.940
you one model of the problem of current

03:36.940 --> 03:39.720
design practice and how to address it. And

03:39.720 --> 03:42.660
I'm showing you this because this is not

03:42.660 --> 03:46.600
our model. And I'll let you digest it

03:46.600 --> 03:46.800
here.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.440
So this wonderful cartoon, which I like

03:56.440 --> 03:59.860
very much, posits a particular view of

03:59.860 --> 04:02.540
what the problem might be with existing

04:02.540 --> 04:04.460
design practice and how it might be

04:04.460 --> 04:07.720
corrected. And we're interested in viewing

04:07.720 --> 04:11.040
both sides of this in a very different

04:11.040 --> 04:14.280
way. You know, we see this not as a

04:14.280 --> 04:16.980
behavioral problem of individual

04:16.980 --> 04:19.800
designers, but as a very complex and

04:19.800 --> 04:23.520
multifaceted problem that really includes

04:23.520 --> 04:26.660
how design as a practice is currently

04:26.660 --> 04:32.600
located within what I think are two self

04:32.600 --> 04:35.380
-contained sort of insular environments

04:35.380 --> 04:37.540
environments and sort of overly

04:37.540 --> 04:39.400
professionalized world so that even

04:39.400 --> 04:42.080
designers, practicing designers who would

04:42.080 --> 04:44.340
really like to do things in a different

04:44.340 --> 04:46.720
way find it quite difficult to do that.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.080
And it shifts from being a kind of a

04:49.080 --> 04:51.340
psychological problem to being a social

04:51.340 --> 04:55.180
problem and one that implicates I think a

04:55.180 --> 04:57.840
fairly broad range of forms of social

04:57.840 --> 04:59.960
change if we really want want to address

04:59.960 --> 05:02.940
it that have to do with how the working

05:02.940 --> 05:05.820
relationships of technology production and

05:05.820 --> 05:08.700
use are currently organized. I'm not going

05:08.700 --> 05:11.400
to elaborate on that today, but that's

05:11.400 --> 05:14.860
kind of a framing for how we're looking at

05:14.860 --> 05:18.160
the question of design practice and

05:18.160 --> 05:23.420
potential changes and improvements to it.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.980
And let me give you, just to continue the

05:28.980 --> 05:31.740
prelude here a little bit longer, another

05:31.740 --> 05:34.720
kind of motivating view of our motivating

05:34.720 --> 05:38.620
problem. Any of you who have heard me talk

05:38.620 --> 05:40.280
before have probably seen this slide

05:40.280 --> 05:42.600
because I'm very fond of it. I apologize

05:42.600 --> 05:46.300
for any repetition. But it's an image

05:46.300 --> 05:49.980
that's taken from an ad in a computing

05:49.980 --> 05:53.260
magazine a few years back. and the

05:53.260 --> 05:56.520
question that it asks is why do this at

05:56.520 --> 05:58.280
the top you have the sort of proverbial

05:58.280 --> 06:00.560
paper napkin on which brilliant ideas have

06:00.560 --> 06:02.580
been scribbled over the course of a lunch

06:02.580 --> 06:05.280
and so the question is why do this use a

06:05.280 --> 06:07.680
paper napkin when you can do this and it's

06:07.680 --> 06:09.560
a little hard to see but we've got these

06:09.560 --> 06:11.980
two guys sitting at a very small table and

06:11.980 --> 06:14.700
they have a laptop in between them and of

06:14.700 --> 06:16.220
course it's not clear you know where they

06:16.220 --> 06:18.300
would put their lunch or their napkins or

06:18.300 --> 06:20.200
whatever but you know it's a little bit of

06:20.200 --> 06:23.940
poetic or artistic license here. And the

06:23.940 --> 06:26.880
project that we've taken on, I think of it

06:26.880 --> 06:29.120
as taking this as a serious question. So

06:29.120 --> 06:31.280
rather than treating it as a kind of

06:31.280 --> 06:33.100
rhetorical question, as I think the

06:33.100 --> 06:34.860
writers of this ad copy do, you know, the

06:34.860 --> 06:36.700
answer to this question is self-evident,

06:36.780 --> 06:39.080
we're saying, well, you know, what might

06:39.080 --> 06:41.480
be the reasons that you would do this

06:41.480 --> 06:44.920
given the opportunity to do that? And that

06:44.920 --> 06:49.460
starts by taking existing artifacts

06:49.460 --> 06:53.320
seriously. Paper napkins as, you know, for

06:53.320 --> 06:56.420
us an extremely relevant artifact in so

06:56.420 --> 06:58.040
far as, in this case, it's been turned

06:58.040 --> 07:00.400
into a document. And that's what we're

07:00.400 --> 07:02.920
interested in at Xerox. But so let's start

07:02.920 --> 07:05.640
by seeing what are the media that people

07:05.640 --> 07:07.540
are using at present. And what are the

07:07.540 --> 07:09.300
particular resources that those media

07:09.300 --> 07:12.100
provide? and have that as a background

07:12.100 --> 07:14.580
that informs the answer to the question,

07:14.820 --> 07:18.140
how is the introduction of new media, how

07:18.140 --> 07:19.780
does the introduction of new media relate

07:19.780 --> 07:23.360
to the use of existing media? So we want

07:23.360 --> 07:25.320
to take it as a serious question. We also

07:25.320 --> 07:29.280
want to, again, I think that this image

07:29.280 --> 07:32.340
assumes that we're in a situation where

07:32.340 --> 07:34.540
we're going from one medium to the next.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.000
So it's going to be a wholesale

07:36.000 --> 07:39.220
displacement transformation. this is the

07:39.220 --> 07:43.020
paperless office sort of fantasy. And

07:43.020 --> 07:47.680
instead, we're going to assume that we are

07:47.680 --> 07:49.640
now and will continue to be living in a

07:49.640 --> 07:54.140
world made up of multiple media. That for

07:54.140 --> 07:57.760
a lot of both practical reasons, paper is

07:57.760 --> 07:59.600
going to be staying around. It's just

07:59.600 --> 08:01.800
tremendously, there's a very, very

08:01.800 --> 08:05.000
extensive investment in paper media that

08:05.000 --> 08:07.140
can't be transformed overnight. night and

08:07.140 --> 08:11.200
also of course as people like my

08:11.200 --> 08:13.680
colleagues Abby Sellin and Richard Harper

08:13.680 --> 08:16.520
at the Cambridge lab of Xerox have pointed

08:16.520 --> 08:19.460
out paper has certain affordances that are

08:19.460 --> 08:22.700
that are quite powerful and effective so

08:22.700 --> 08:24.960
for both practical reasons and because

08:24.960 --> 08:29.120
paper is a useful medium we are going to

08:29.120 --> 08:30.720
continue to live in a world that's made up

08:30.720 --> 08:35.320
of multiple media and the sense I have is

08:35.320 --> 08:37.600
that you know we might just be becoming

08:37.600 --> 08:39.940
sophisticated enough technologically that

08:39.940 --> 08:44.040
we can actually design for a world that

08:44.040 --> 08:46.140
includes both paper and digital media and

08:46.140 --> 08:49.040
that involves of course making it much

08:49.040 --> 08:52.420
easier for people to move between those

08:52.420 --> 08:54.700
media so that's the goal is supporting

08:54.700 --> 08:56.960
multiple media and and relations between

08:56.960 --> 08:59.080
them rather than you know transforming

08:59.080 --> 09:03.500
ourselves from paper to digital. And then

09:03.500 --> 09:06.580
finally the kind of reworking that we want

09:06.580 --> 09:10.680
to do of this image is rather than taking

09:10.680 --> 09:13.100
the artifacts, the technologies that we're

09:13.100 --> 09:15.760
interested in as these objects floating in

09:15.760 --> 09:18.640
white space as they are so nicely here, we

09:18.640 --> 09:21.620
want to locate them in the environments

09:21.620 --> 09:23.060
where they're actually going to be used.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.600
And that means going out into work sites

09:26.600 --> 09:28.560
and seeing how it is that people are

09:28.560 --> 09:31.780
actually using the artifacts and the

09:31.780 --> 09:33.960
technologies that we're interested in in

09:33.960 --> 09:35.560
the course of their everyday activities.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.660
Okay, so with that kind of background,

09:41.180 --> 09:43.900
what I'm going to try to do in the time

09:43.900 --> 09:46.400
that remains is first a little bit of an

09:46.400 --> 09:49.000
introduction, again, to give you a sense

09:49.000 --> 09:51.920
of a couple of general aspects of the

09:51.920 --> 09:53.660
approach that we're taking. The first,

09:53.800 --> 09:56.040
what we're calling case-based prototyping,

09:56.100 --> 09:58.400
which I'll explain, and then this idea of

09:58.400 --> 10:01.220
working document collections. And then

10:01.220 --> 10:04.020
having sort of talked briefly about those

10:04.020 --> 10:06.620
two general ideas, move into the specific

10:06.620 --> 10:08.300
project that we're involved with at

10:08.300 --> 10:10.800
Caltrans, and in particular our work with

10:10.800 --> 10:12.680
their project files, and then the

10:12.680 --> 10:16.520
prototype that we've developed to address

10:16.520 --> 10:21.400
the problems that we've found. Okay, so

10:21.400 --> 10:24.540
first of all case-based prototypes. This

10:24.540 --> 10:28.960
is another kind of framing image for the

10:28.960 --> 10:32.060
work that we're doing, which is focused on

10:32.060 --> 10:36.120
this idea of the project of design being

10:36.120 --> 10:38.940
artful integration. that increasingly

10:38.940 --> 10:43.260
design is as much if not more about

10:43.260 --> 10:47.460
embedding artifacts and technologies new

10:47.460 --> 10:50.860
in new ways into existing environments as

10:50.860 --> 10:53.980
it is about inventing things completely de

10:53.980 --> 10:56.720
novo so and the things that we're trying

10:56.720 --> 11:01.580
to integrate are both to integrate the

11:01.580 --> 11:03.860
technology both with the activities that

11:03.860 --> 11:05.220
people are engaged in with their work

11:05.220 --> 11:07.120
practices and with the rest of their

11:07.120 --> 11:09.560
technology environment. And a sort of

11:09.560 --> 11:12.940
center for that for us is what we're

11:12.940 --> 11:14.820
calling case-based prototypes. Case-based

11:14.820 --> 11:18.040
because these are prototypes that actually

11:18.040 --> 11:22.220
incorporate real work, some understanding

11:22.220 --> 11:24.460
of real work practices and work materials

11:24.460 --> 11:27.080
into them in contrast to some of the

11:27.080 --> 11:29.880
demonstration prototypes that we have

11:29.880 --> 11:32.160
around that take some kind of a generic

11:32.160 --> 11:35.180
corpus of materials and try to show what

11:35.180 --> 11:37.460
it would be like to work with the system.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.400
And our experience is that when people are

11:40.400 --> 11:42.360
assessing a prototype that actually has

11:42.360 --> 11:45.160
their documents in it, their work

11:45.160 --> 11:48.280
materials, they have a base for doing that

11:48.280 --> 11:50.980
assessment that's much, much richer than

11:50.980 --> 11:54.360
if they're looking at the Encyclopedia

11:54.360 --> 11:56.460
Britannica or something that we all kind

11:56.460 --> 11:58.260
of recognize but none of us is actively

11:58.260 --> 12:00.840
engaged with. So it strengthens the

12:00.840 --> 12:02.560
grounds on which people can assess the

12:02.560 --> 12:06.300
prototype. And then the other piece of

12:06.300 --> 12:07.900
integration that we're trying to do in our

12:07.900 --> 12:11.420
prototypes is to bring together the work

12:11.420 --> 12:13.580
that people are doing with both emerging

12:13.580 --> 12:15.760
park technologies and existing Xerox

12:15.760 --> 12:16.920
technologies. So we're trying to

12:16.920 --> 12:19.360
configure, sort of craft together an

12:19.360 --> 12:21.320
interesting relationship between those

12:21.320 --> 12:23.280
things, and the prototype is the

12:23.280 --> 12:25.900
manifestation, the demonstration of that.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.080
And the particular focus for us has been

12:29.080 --> 12:30.860
this relationship between paper and

12:30.860 --> 12:34.260
digital media, both the kinds of

12:34.260 --> 12:36.060
translations that we have to enable

12:36.060 --> 12:39.280
between the two and also the kind of

12:39.280 --> 12:41.260
cohabitations that we want them to be able

12:41.260 --> 12:43.240
to do. What does it mean to live in a

12:43.240 --> 12:46.360
world where some of your documents are on

12:46.360 --> 12:48.220
paper, some are online, they're shifting

12:48.220 --> 12:50.400
back and forth across that border? How do

12:50.400 --> 12:55.160
you maintain the coherence across media in

12:55.160 --> 12:59.260
that kind of situation? And then given the

12:59.260 --> 13:01.880
general strategy of case-based

13:01.880 --> 13:04.080
prototyping, the focus that we've taken

13:04.080 --> 13:07.360
recently has been this idea of working

13:07.360 --> 13:09.480
document collections. And here's a sort of

13:09.480 --> 13:13.660
set of defining is probably too strong a

13:13.660 --> 13:16.080
term, but characterizing criteria for

13:16.080 --> 13:18.780
those. Basically, what we mean by working

13:18.780 --> 13:21.040
collections are the documents that are in

13:21.040 --> 13:23.140
between the documents that are on your

13:23.140 --> 13:25.160
desk at any given moment. Although for

13:25.160 --> 13:26.720
most of us, I think many of the documents

13:26.720 --> 13:28.320
on our desk should be in our working

13:28.320 --> 13:30.760
collection. But the idealized view is that

13:30.760 --> 13:33.020
you have this sort of three-part division.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.760
You've got your active documents on your

13:34.760 --> 13:36.860
desk. You've got documents that are often

13:36.860 --> 13:39.860
in archives somewhere, filed some distance

13:39.860 --> 13:42.860
from your office. And then you've got your

13:42.860 --> 13:44.560
working document collections, the

13:44.560 --> 13:46.520
canonical form of this is your file

13:46.520 --> 13:51.040
cabinets. And our premise is that many

13:51.040 --> 13:53.700
organizations have a tremendous investment

13:54.100 --> 13:56.360
in document collections that have this

13:56.360 --> 13:59.300
character, and that there's a large

13:59.300 --> 14:03.080
opportunity in finding ways to help people

14:03.080 --> 14:05.500
partly migrate those collections online,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.440
partly integrate those collections with

14:08.440 --> 14:10.020
their with their online document

14:12.080 --> 14:14.140
repositories the the documents that get

14:14.140 --> 14:15.780
into this these collections are

14:15.780 --> 14:18.420
selectively saved by people with the idea

14:18.420 --> 14:20.560
that they're going to be useful either as

14:20.560 --> 14:23.020
a reference or maybe actually to be reused

14:23.020 --> 14:25.300
in some way in the future and and very

14:25.300 --> 14:28.420
importantly you can it's very difficult to

14:28.420 --> 14:30.060
predict what the value of any given

14:30.060 --> 14:31.620
document is going to be in advance you

14:31.620 --> 14:34.120
couldn't go through most most file

14:34.120 --> 14:35.680
cabinets and definitely the collection

14:35.680 --> 14:36.900
that I'm going to be talking about at

14:36.900 --> 14:39.220
Caltrans and weight the documents

14:39.220 --> 14:41.520
according to their value because the value

14:41.520 --> 14:43.660
of the document is tied to its

14:43.660 --> 14:45.300
availability at the moment when it's

14:45.300 --> 14:48.680
needed. It becomes valuable in relation to

14:48.680 --> 14:50.780
some ongoing activity. So it's this

14:50.780 --> 14:54.860
contingent value that depends much more on

14:54.860 --> 14:56.560
the accessibility of the document in

14:56.560 --> 14:58.500
relation to the activity than on its

14:58.500 --> 15:02.260
intrinsic characteristics. The The

15:02.260 --> 15:03.760
documents in the collections that we're

15:03.760 --> 15:05.800
looking at are very diverse, both in

15:05.800 --> 15:07.440
quality, they include everything from

15:07.440 --> 15:10.160
documents that have been faxed three times

15:10.160 --> 15:13.520
and photocopied to very, very nice,

15:13.580 --> 15:17.360
cleanly printed ASCII documents, and also

15:17.360 --> 15:19.960
very variable in format, and I'll show you

15:19.960 --> 15:22.040
more of that. The thing that interests us

15:22.040 --> 15:23.980
about that is, again, a sense that when we

15:23.980 --> 15:26.780
look at the document repositories that are

15:26.780 --> 15:29.900
often used in research, they tend to be

15:29.900 --> 15:32.780
rather homogeneous. So people who are

15:32.780 --> 15:35.920
doing different aspects of document image

15:35.920 --> 15:37.900
and document recognition and document

15:37.900 --> 15:40.040
retrieval work are working with these sort

15:40.040 --> 15:42.320
of standard corpora. And when we look at

15:42.320 --> 15:44.280
these real world corpora, they have

15:44.280 --> 15:46.800
different characteristics that pose some

15:46.800 --> 15:49.640
interesting problems and challenges.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.920
Document research, document search through

15:53.920 --> 15:55.960
these collections relies very heavily on

15:55.960 --> 15:57.460
their visual characteristics. I mean this

15:57.460 --> 15:59.520
is just a simple observation that when you

15:59.520 --> 16:02.900
go to your paper file cabinet, you get a

16:02.900 --> 16:04.740
huge amount of information from being able

16:04.740 --> 16:07.540
to scan the visual organization of the

16:07.540 --> 16:09.720
folders, to open up a folder and scan

16:09.720 --> 16:11.500
through the documents that are in there.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.380
And so images, we have a very strong

16:14.380 --> 16:15.900
emphasis as you'll see on preserving

16:15.900 --> 16:20.160
document images. Shared access to the

16:20.160 --> 16:22.300
collection is facilitated by its creator.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.180
These are collections that generally, you

16:24.180 --> 16:25.680
know, they're owned by somebody and that

16:25.680 --> 16:29.200
person acts, to the extent that the

16:29.200 --> 16:30.980
collections are shared, that person acts

16:30.980 --> 16:33.200
effectively as a kind of librarian for the

16:33.200 --> 16:34.400
collection. And there are really

16:34.400 --> 16:36.480
interesting issues then if you're moving

16:36.480 --> 16:38.980
those collections online, giving people

16:38.980 --> 16:41.580
distributed access, what happens to the

16:41.580 --> 16:44.820
role of the owner or the collector of the

16:44.820 --> 16:48.820
corpus. And then finally, it's important

16:48.820 --> 16:50.700
that you can get to these things easily,

16:50.700 --> 16:53.260
because often these are documents that, as

16:53.260 --> 16:54.780
I said, you need them in the midst of an

16:54.780 --> 16:56.960
ongoing activity, and if you can't get a

16:56.960 --> 16:58.020
hold of them, you're going to work around

16:58.020 --> 16:59.820
it in some way. You're not going to send

16:59.820 --> 17:01.760
off and wait a couple of days to get them

17:01.760 --> 17:04.000
back. Yeah? Just for a point of

17:04.000 --> 17:07.080
clarification, so if we're talking about a

17:07.080 --> 17:08.980
facility design, during the actual design

17:08.980 --> 17:10.880
process, the documents will be active,

17:11.360 --> 17:14.340
whereas once the facility was complete and

17:14.340 --> 17:16.820
it goes to management phase, it would be a

17:16.820 --> 17:18.800
working collection? No, no. No, I mean,

17:18.820 --> 17:20.260
I'm glad you asked that question because

17:20.260 --> 17:24.460
it's very much not tied to across a

17:24.460 --> 17:27.780
project. Documents move from active to

17:27.780 --> 17:31.220
working status in a very dynamic way. I'm

17:31.220 --> 17:33.500
thinking more of when a document is on

17:33.500 --> 17:35.260
your desk and you're working with it, it's

17:35.260 --> 17:36.640
active, and when you stick it in your

17:36.640 --> 17:37.920
filing cabinet, it's in your working

17:37.920 --> 17:39.560
collection. And in the case that we're

17:39.560 --> 17:41.400
looking at, as you'll see, things are

17:41.400 --> 17:43.280
coming in and out of the collection all

17:43.280 --> 17:48.140
the time. So it's more dynamic than that.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.400
Okay, alright so where are we? We're

17:52.400 --> 17:56.100
actually spending most of our time in

17:56.100 --> 17:59.500
Oakland at Caltrans District 4

17:59.500 --> 18:01.100
headquarters, which is the district that's

18:01.100 --> 18:03.640
responsible for the entire Bay area,

18:03.920 --> 18:05.540
basically all the roads and the toll

18:05.540 --> 18:08.880
bridges in the Bay area. And within the

18:08.880 --> 18:13.140
District 4 headquarters, we're working

18:13.140 --> 18:16.680
with a particular project team. And if

18:16.680 --> 18:18.400
people are interested, I mean there are a

18:18.400 --> 18:20.660
lot of practical things to be said about

18:20.660 --> 18:23.020
how we got into Caltrans, how once we got

18:23.020 --> 18:25.080
to Caltrans we sort of found our way to

18:25.080 --> 18:27.360
this particular project. Having to do

18:27.360 --> 18:29.580
with, again, the practicalities of sort of

18:29.580 --> 18:32.020
crafting a manageable and relevant

18:32.020 --> 18:35.000
project. But we are working with the team

18:35.000 --> 18:37.320
of engineers who are involved in doing a

18:37.320 --> 18:38.920
replacement bridge over the Carcuna

18:38.920 --> 18:42.280
Straits, which are in the north part of

18:42.280 --> 18:45.020
the San Francisco Bay. and these are, some

18:45.020 --> 18:46.580
of you have probably driven across these

18:46.580 --> 18:49.880
two bridges, they're a pair of old trestle

18:49.880 --> 18:54.080
bridges. This one on your right was built

18:54.080 --> 18:56.800
in 1927 and the other one was built in

18:56.800 --> 19:00.580
1958. And what's happened is while there's

19:00.580 --> 19:03.000
not any new bridge building going on in

19:03.000 --> 19:06.880
the Bay Area, there are funds for seismic

19:06.880 --> 19:10.160
retrofitting. And Caltrans has made the

19:10.160 --> 19:12.840
argument that they're going to retrofit

19:12.840 --> 19:15.660
the 58 bridge, but the 27 bridge is

19:15.660 --> 19:18.340
sufficiently old and out of date that it

19:18.340 --> 19:20.580
doesn't make sense to retrofit it. So they

19:20.580 --> 19:22.900
have proposed replacement as a retrofit

19:22.900 --> 19:24.960
strategy, which is a phrase I like very

19:24.960 --> 19:26.940
much. And that means that they can take

19:26.940 --> 19:29.580
funds that have been allocated for seismic

19:29.580 --> 19:31.280
retrofitting and use them to build a new

19:31.280 --> 19:33.460
bridge, which is what engineers most like

19:33.460 --> 19:37.020
to do. So they are actually going to take

19:37.020 --> 19:39.520
down the old 27 bridge and put up a new

19:39.520 --> 19:41.620
one. And that's the project that we've

19:41.620 --> 19:42.960
been following for the last couple of

19:42.960 --> 19:46.140
years through, up until now it's largely

19:46.140 --> 19:48.680
been what they call the design phase, the

19:48.680 --> 19:50.880
environmental phase, where they're going

19:50.880 --> 19:52.120
out and doing all of the environmental

19:52.120 --> 19:54.460
impact assessments and basically getting

19:54.460 --> 19:56.080
permission to go ahead with the project.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.940
And they're just now moving into the

19:57.940 --> 20:02.500
design phase. Now within, as fascinating

20:02.500 --> 20:05.200
as the bridge is, and we've spent a lot of

20:05.200 --> 20:07.020
time doing things like following them to

20:07.020 --> 20:09.940
town meetings in Crockett where they have

20:09.940 --> 20:11.620
talked to the local citizens about the

20:11.620 --> 20:14.260
project. For us as anthropologists this is

20:14.260 --> 20:16.160
an opportunity to do some very wonderful

20:16.160 --> 20:19.220
ethnography of how a bridge gets built and

20:19.220 --> 20:22.520
relations between engineers and citizens

20:22.520 --> 20:25.240
and that sort of thing. But for us in our

20:25.240 --> 20:28.320
capacity as park researchers doing a

20:28.320 --> 20:31.700
prototyping project, the focus has been on

20:31.700 --> 20:34.080
what are called the project files. And

20:34.080 --> 20:36.820
project files are collections that are

20:36.820 --> 20:39.280
maintained by every engineering team at

20:39.280 --> 20:41.920
Caltrans. It's an obligatory collection

20:41.920 --> 20:45.340
that you have to create that is basically

20:45.340 --> 20:47.520
a cumulative collection of relevant

20:47.520 --> 20:50.160
documents that are created and acquired

20:50.160 --> 20:53.060
over the course of a project. And as you

20:53.060 --> 20:55.800
can see they are currently kept on paper

20:55.800 --> 21:00.900
in three ring binders. And I'll tell you

21:00.900 --> 21:02.860
more about them but just to say that one

21:02.860 --> 21:04.580
of the things that, you know, when we were

21:04.580 --> 21:07.300
again sort of in terms of how a project

21:07.300 --> 21:09.940
like ours gets designed, when we were

21:09.940 --> 21:11.900
starting to talk with the project team

21:11.900 --> 21:13.740
about what they were up to and how we

21:13.740 --> 21:15.700
might do some interesting kind of

21:15.700 --> 21:17.880
collaboration together, together, we

21:17.880 --> 21:19.600
realized that the project files were

21:19.600 --> 21:23.240
another instance of what we're calling

21:23.240 --> 21:24.800
working document collection and that we

21:24.800 --> 21:27.300
had worked with it with an interestingly

21:27.300 --> 21:30.120
similar and different collection in our

21:30.120 --> 21:32.300
previous project, which was in a law firm,

21:32.500 --> 21:35.720
where we worked with a particular attorney

21:35.720 --> 21:39.120
taking, again, a paper collection of his

21:39.120 --> 21:42.340
documents and moving them online,

21:42.640 --> 21:44.340
exploring what it would mean to move them

21:44.340 --> 21:48.920
online. So it was for us a way of building

21:48.920 --> 21:52.020
on our previous projects, of bringing

21:52.020 --> 21:54.840
together the specifics of this particular

21:54.840 --> 21:59.220
work site and its practices with a more

21:59.220 --> 22:02.140
sort of cumulative general understanding

22:02.140 --> 22:05.000
of how these kinds of collections work.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.340
work. And the other thing that struck us

22:09.340 --> 22:12.480
was, again, as in the law firm collection,

22:12.840 --> 22:15.280
the tremendous heterogeneity of the

22:15.280 --> 22:17.480
documents that are in the project files.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.500
They include a lot of general business

22:20.500 --> 22:23.960
documents, letters and memos and reports

22:23.960 --> 22:27.340
and spreadsheets and tables and that sort

22:27.340 --> 22:30.520
of thing. And then also things like

22:30.520 --> 22:32.740
newspaper clippings. So they clip you

22:32.740 --> 22:34.640
know, articles that come out about

22:34.640 --> 22:36.440
Caltrans that are relevant to the project.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.320
And then a lot of interesting more

22:39.320 --> 22:42.900
engineering specific documents, maps, and

22:42.900 --> 22:46.160
plans of various kinds, all ingeniously

22:46.160 --> 22:49.300
folded to fit in an 8.5 by 11 inch binder.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.240
So we've got documents of, you know, a lot

22:52.240 --> 22:54.940
of different kinds of genre and format,

22:55.240 --> 22:58.080
and a lot of different sizes and that sort

22:58.080 --> 22:59.300
of thing. So the question is, you know,

22:59.300 --> 23:00.940
how are you actually going to deal with

23:00.940 --> 23:03.560
this when you're thinking of moving this

23:03.560 --> 23:07.560
collection from one medium to another? The

23:07.560 --> 23:10.120
other thing that fascinated us was that in

23:10.120 --> 23:12.120
spite of the tremendous heterogeneity of

23:12.120 --> 23:15.180
these documents, they were all to be filed

23:15.180 --> 23:17.460
according to the Caltrans Uniform Filing

23:17.460 --> 23:22.040
System, which as a piece of classification

23:22.040 --> 23:24.640
is a really, really interesting artifact

23:24.640 --> 23:27.320
in its own right. The Caltrans Uniform

23:27.320 --> 23:31.060
Filing System is a basically

23:31.060 --> 23:33.840
hierarchically nested set of categories

23:33.840 --> 23:36.740
that are in principle to be used

23:36.740 --> 23:39.420
throughout Caltrans. It's really

23:39.420 --> 23:41.520
interesting when you start to look at the

23:41.520 --> 23:43.460
Uniform Filing System how incredibly

23:43.460 --> 23:48.000
dynamic it becomes. It changes both, it's

23:48.000 --> 23:49.980
changed from the sort of central

23:49.980 --> 23:53.860
headquarters and then it's changed, it's,

23:53.860 --> 23:56.920
you know, with permission customized

23:56.920 --> 24:01.800
locally. And so I'll talk more about that

24:01.800 --> 24:03.300
when I tell you about the prototype, but

24:03.300 --> 24:06.120
the uniform filing system turns out to be

24:06.120 --> 24:08.800
in fact a constantly sort of shifting and

24:08.800 --> 24:12.940
transformed set of categorization scheme.

24:13.980 --> 24:15.840
Another interesting thing about it from

24:15.840 --> 24:17.240
the point of view of classification is

24:17.240 --> 24:18.180
that it's got all these different

24:18.180 --> 24:21.160
interests in it. Partly it's organized by

24:21.160 --> 24:23.100
the kind of phases of a project, so it's

24:23.100 --> 24:26.720
orienting to producing a kind of archival

24:26.720 --> 24:28.920
historical record at the end of the

24:28.920 --> 24:31.660
project. It's also oriented to the types

24:31.660 --> 24:33.620
of documents, so whether it's

24:33.620 --> 24:35.640
correspondence or reports of various

24:35.640 --> 24:39.260
kinds, it's oriented to topical issues.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.280
and all of these different cross-cutting

24:42.280 --> 24:45.780
interests are sort of homogenized and

24:45.780 --> 24:47.880
flattened in in this apparently

24:47.880 --> 24:51.720
straightforward hierarchical system but of

24:51.720 --> 24:53.200
course when you actually go to file

24:53.200 --> 24:55.940
documents you run into into that and I'll

24:55.940 --> 25:01.420
show you more about that there are there

25:01.420 --> 25:04.460
is a perceived problem around around

25:04.460 --> 25:06.800
getting documents into the project files.

25:06.980 --> 25:10.720
It is a perpetual trouble for people. For

25:10.720 --> 25:13.220
all sorts of reasons, certainly in part, I

25:13.220 --> 25:15.160
think part of the reason that we're all so

25:15.160 --> 25:18.880
behind in our filing is that it's not a

25:18.880 --> 25:20.780
straightforward task. For any given

25:20.780 --> 25:23.220
document, there are so many possible ways

25:23.220 --> 25:26.500
of filing it. And so it's a hard problem,

25:26.560 --> 25:28.580
and as a consequence, things pile up. And

25:28.580 --> 25:31.300
this is the two-file cardboard box sitting

25:31.300 --> 25:35.880
on the desk of the senior engineer. So we

25:35.880 --> 25:38.420
became interested in understanding more

25:38.420 --> 25:41.180
about what actually is hard about filing

25:41.180 --> 25:43.600
documents. Here's another activity which

25:43.600 --> 25:46.680
is typically seen as a completely mindless

25:46.680 --> 25:49.880
activity, but which somehow when any of us

25:49.880 --> 25:52.660
actually goes to try to do it, opens out

25:52.660 --> 25:55.100
into something more problematic and what's

25:55.100 --> 25:57.120
going on there. So what we did was we

25:57.120 --> 25:59.540
spent some time with the senior, The other

25:59.540 --> 26:01.880
thing I should say is that at Caltrans, as

26:01.880 --> 26:04.100
with many organizations, budgets have been

26:04.100 --> 26:06.020
cut. There's very little administrative

26:06.020 --> 26:08.800
support. The engineers themselves are

26:08.800 --> 26:10.800
responsible for doing the filing of their

26:10.800 --> 26:14.380
documents. So we spent some time with the

26:14.380 --> 26:18.140
senior project engineer, sitting with him

26:18.140 --> 26:20.580
while he worked on trying to file some of

26:20.580 --> 26:22.180
these documents that were on his desk that

26:22.180 --> 26:23.860
he wanted to get into the project files.

26:23.860 --> 26:27.160
And this is my colleague Randy watching

26:27.160 --> 26:30.000
sympathetically as Dave sort of talks his

26:30.000 --> 26:32.440
way through some filing. And at this point

26:32.440 --> 26:34.820
I want to show you a videotape if we're

26:34.820 --> 26:37.520
queued up. I'm going to show you a few

26:37.520 --> 26:44.600
little bits of recorded Dave filing. And

26:44.600 --> 26:49.100
in the first one, let me just orient you a

26:49.100 --> 26:50.260
little bit to what you're going to see.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.440
Well, I'll show it to you and then just

26:53.440 --> 26:55.380
point out what I think are some of the

26:55.380 --> 26:57.240
interesting issues. And here's a

26:57.240 --> 26:59.080
transcript in case you have any trouble

26:59.080 --> 27:02.700
hearing. Can I show the overhead and the

27:02.700 --> 27:05.800
tape at the same time or should we? I feel

27:05.800 --> 27:08.240
I'm talking to some unknown assistant

27:08.240 --> 27:12.300
here. Over there, right? I can't. Okay. So

27:12.300 --> 27:13.580
we'll just look at the tape and then I'll

27:13.580 --> 27:14.460
put the transcript up.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.460
store these things you know like for

27:24.460 --> 27:28.480
instance this one right here it's our

27:28.480 --> 27:33.160
letter to the FHWA regarding consultation

27:33.160 --> 27:35.660
for the Endangered Species Act so there's

27:35.660 --> 27:37.620
a permit involved environmental is

27:37.620 --> 27:40.940
involved the federal FHWA is involved

27:40.940 --> 27:42.740
external agencies so there's all these

27:42.740 --> 27:45.040
categories that can conceivably go under

27:45.040 --> 27:47.980
and I have to pick one. Then I have to go

27:47.980 --> 27:49.880
back and maybe search for because maybe I

27:49.880 --> 27:52.700
wasn't thinking the same on the next time

27:52.700 --> 27:54.260
when I'm looking back. So that's why it'd

27:54.260 --> 27:56.800
be really cool if you know if you can

27:56.800 --> 27:58.420
enter these things one like you had you

27:58.420 --> 28:01.000
said you could you could have a date or a

28:01.000 --> 28:03.420
title or Subject or keyword or whatever.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.600
That's why I think it'd be really handy

28:04.600 --> 28:06.240
because I'm sitting here and I'm going

28:06.240 --> 28:06.540
well

28:09.260 --> 28:10.980
Correspondence to federal agencies. Yeah,

28:10.980 --> 28:13.200
that's the one I think it is But it could

28:13.200 --> 28:14.820
easily be thrown underneath permit. And

28:14.820 --> 28:17.520
certainly my assessment may be different

28:17.520 --> 28:19.960
than the guy in the next aisle over. Not

28:19.960 --> 28:21.400
when he's trying to fire a lady, when

28:21.400 --> 28:22.360
they're trying to find him.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.820
Okay, so. I don't see what I thought I was

28:27.820 --> 28:30.660
looking. I'm going to show you one more.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.520
Okay, so, you know, this is all really

28:33.520 --> 28:36.320
familiar and mundane stuff. But, you know,

28:36.360 --> 28:37.700
it's stuff that we all know, but we've

28:37.700 --> 28:39.860
never figured out exactly what to do about

28:39.860 --> 28:41.560
it. You know, we've got the problem.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.980
you've got multiple alternative

28:42.980 --> 28:45.880
categories, any one of which could make

28:45.880 --> 28:48.240
sense depending on how you reason about

28:48.240 --> 28:50.980
it. Then you've got the problem of how do

28:50.980 --> 28:52.940
you align the way you're going to reason

28:52.940 --> 28:54.560
about the document when you're filing it

28:54.560 --> 28:55.680
and the way you're going to be reasoning

28:55.680 --> 28:57.680
about it when you go to look for it. And

28:57.680 --> 29:00.580
Dave's uneasy feeling that if he comes up

29:00.580 --> 29:02.580
with one sort of logic right now for how

29:02.580 --> 29:06.120
to file it, he's trying to anticipate when

29:06.120 --> 29:08.180
he goes to look for this thing, how is he

29:08.180 --> 29:10.360
likely to be thinking about it. And then

29:10.360 --> 29:12.840
finally he worries at the end about the

29:12.840 --> 29:15.360
obvious problem of whether the way he

29:15.360 --> 29:17.360
thinks about it is going to be the same as

29:17.360 --> 29:19.640
the way, you know, the guy or lady, as he

29:19.640 --> 29:22.100
says in the next cubicle, overthinks about

29:22.100 --> 29:24.040
it. So these are all, you know, familiar

29:24.040 --> 29:28.080
kinds of problems around cataloging and

29:28.080 --> 29:30.460
filing of documents. Let me show you one

29:30.460 --> 29:35.180
more little clip now from the same session

29:35.180 --> 29:35.660
with Dave.

29:39.980 --> 29:43.400
I guess I would stick it under floodplain

29:43.400 --> 29:44.320
evaluations.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.280
Where was the other spot? Drainage is

29:49.280 --> 29:52.320
usually done during the design phase, and

29:52.320 --> 29:54.840
we're not there yet. So that's why I

29:54.840 --> 29:58.860
always pick... This is 4D2, 5D2. But see,

29:58.900 --> 30:01.340
231 is draft environmental document, which

30:01.340 --> 30:06.960
is pretty vague. So I'll never find it. I

30:06.960 --> 30:08.660
would probably be more inclined to stick

30:08.660 --> 30:10.100
it under drainage even though that's not

30:10.100 --> 30:13.820
where it belongs. I don't know what else.

30:14.220 --> 30:17.460
That's what I'm going to do. I'm probably

30:17.460 --> 30:19.000
not doing it right, but that's what I

30:19.000 --> 30:21.480
would do. This is why your system would be

30:21.480 --> 30:26.500
nice. So again, another sort of related

30:26.500 --> 30:29.420
set of problems here. In the beginning

30:29.420 --> 30:30.880
here, he's looking through the uniform

30:30.880 --> 30:32.520
filing system itself. itself is like an

30:32.520 --> 30:34.060
eight-page document. He's sitting there

30:34.060 --> 30:35.460
searching through the uniform filing

30:35.460 --> 30:37.200
system for the category that he's looking

30:37.200 --> 30:39.720
for that he thinks he wants to assign this

30:39.720 --> 30:42.820
document to. Again, he's worrying here

30:42.820 --> 30:44.860
about this misalignment between the kind

30:44.860 --> 30:47.460
of normative chronological order of the

30:47.460 --> 30:50.000
classification scheme and the topical

30:50.000 --> 30:52.440
content of the document that he's got,

30:52.520 --> 30:55.320
which is about drainage, which has come up

30:55.320 --> 30:57.940
in terms of an evaluation of a floodplain

30:57.940 --> 30:59.880
in the environmental stage, but the

30:59.880 --> 31:02.180
drainage category is farther down in the

31:02.180 --> 31:05.880
design. So how does he adjudicate that?

31:06.180 --> 31:09.140
And again, he's thinking here about how am

31:09.140 --> 31:10.800
I going to file it such that when I go to

31:10.800 --> 31:12.340
look for it, there's some hope that I'll

31:12.340 --> 31:14.380
actually find it. Now let me show you a

31:14.380 --> 31:18.880
couple of clips around search. The clip

31:18.880 --> 31:21.840
I'm going to show you was a serendipitous

31:21.840 --> 31:26.100
recording that we were actually up there

31:26.100 --> 31:29.940
installing a board on Dave's PC that would

31:29.940 --> 31:31.980
allow it to talk to our scanner as we were

31:31.980 --> 31:33.800
putting together a prototype. And because

31:33.800 --> 31:36.340
we're interested in all of the grungy

31:36.340 --> 31:38.660
practical details around actually

31:38.660 --> 31:40.160
implementing a prototype, we were

31:40.160 --> 31:42.460
recording this, right? So we're there in

31:42.460 --> 31:45.540
Dave's office and when the clip first

31:45.540 --> 31:46.920
starts, you're going to see my colleague

31:46.920 --> 31:49.460
Randy and one of their IS people under

31:49.460 --> 31:53.000
Dave's desk messing with his PC. And so

31:53.000 --> 31:54.720
we're there recording and Dave comes in

31:54.720 --> 31:56.700
and he picks up the two file box off his

31:56.700 --> 31:58.140
desk and sits down and starts going

31:58.140 --> 32:01.640
through it. So I eventually pan back to

32:01.640 --> 32:03.560
actually see what it is that he's up to.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.520
And you're going to see three little

32:05.520 --> 32:08.060
segments with breaks between them. In the

32:08.060 --> 32:11.200
first, you'll hear a query from my

32:11.200 --> 32:13.340
colleague, Jeanette, to Dave about what

32:13.340 --> 32:15.260
he's searching for. And he explains that

32:15.260 --> 32:17.380
he's looking for the documentation of an

32:17.380 --> 32:20.640
agreement between a local agency and a

32:20.640 --> 32:23.780
local city and Caltrans around an aspect

32:23.780 --> 32:26.280
of their process. And then in the second,

32:26.400 --> 32:29.040
you'll see him find a document and sort of

32:29.040 --> 32:31.300
inspect it and decide, apparently, that

32:31.300 --> 32:33.020
it's what he wants and set it aside. And

32:33.020 --> 32:35.100
then in the final one, we have a little

32:35.100 --> 32:38.720
exchange where he explains to us the

32:38.720 --> 32:40.900
uncertainties about what he's been looking

32:40.900 --> 32:44.560
for. And there's this whole search. I

32:44.560 --> 32:46.060
mean, he went through, you'll see when he

32:46.060 --> 32:47.880
finds the document, he's about two-thirds

32:47.880 --> 32:49.740
of the way through the box. So the whole

32:49.740 --> 32:51.560
thing probably went on for 15 minutes, I

32:51.560 --> 32:53.320
would say. So here are these three little

32:53.320 --> 32:53.720
clips.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.100
Some old resolutions that East Virginia

33:06.100 --> 33:07.500
Regional Park and the city passed in

33:07.500 --> 33:11.020
support of our mitigation project. Yeah,

33:13.100 --> 33:16.240
sure do. Exactly. Exactly.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.500
I don't know if the oven exists.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.840
Yeah, most of the time. I don't think I

34:07.840 --> 34:09.100
actually got one of these things from the

34:09.100 --> 34:09.280
city.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.300
So, at the beginning, as I said, he

34:21.300 --> 34:24.420
explains to us that he's looking for some

34:24.420 --> 34:26.400
old resolutions, as he says, from the East

34:26.400 --> 34:29.580
Bay Regional Parks and the City. So

34:29.580 --> 34:31.240
potentially, at the beginning, he's

34:31.240 --> 34:33.760
looking for two documents, one from each

34:33.760 --> 34:36.720
of these agencies. And then when he talks

34:36.720 --> 34:40.900
to us about what he found, he explains, he

34:40.900 --> 34:43.300
says he's still going through, you saw him

34:43.300 --> 34:45.560
in the middle clip sort of pull out one

34:45.560 --> 34:46.920
document, set it to the side, and then

34:46.920 --> 34:50.460
keep going. And then he announces happily

34:50.460 --> 34:52.440
to us that he actually found something and

34:52.440 --> 34:54.540
explains that now he's starting to wonder

34:54.540 --> 34:56.780
whether there is actually ever was a

34:56.780 --> 34:59.680
second document. So the question here is

34:59.680 --> 35:01.720
what do you know ahead of time about what

35:01.720 --> 35:03.140
you're looking for when you're doing this

35:03.140 --> 35:04.660
kind of search? And here's a case where

35:04.660 --> 35:06.920
Dave goes through the whole box on the

35:06.920 --> 35:11.120
possibility that a document that may or

35:11.120 --> 35:13.120
may not exist was put in there by one of

35:13.120 --> 35:14.540
his colleagues. And that's the kind of

35:14.540 --> 35:18.280
working with the material medium that's

35:18.280 --> 35:23.040
involved in the sort of problematic state

35:23.040 --> 35:26.420
of the project files at the moment. So

35:26.420 --> 35:29.940
what we have been doing together with Dave

35:29.940 --> 35:33.160
and the rest of the engineering team is an

35:33.160 --> 35:35.860
exploration in what would it mean to put

35:35.860 --> 35:38.380
their collection online. And the prototype

35:38.380 --> 35:41.240
that we've built, we hear being used very

35:41.240 --> 35:43.020
loosely to refer to my colleague Randy

35:43.020 --> 35:46.660
Trigg, is called, it's built on top of a

35:46.660 --> 35:48.560
platform called the integrator because the

35:48.560 --> 35:51.600
idea of the integrator has been to try to

35:51.600 --> 35:53.340
build a platform on which we can pull

35:53.340 --> 35:56.680
together as much stuff as possible into a

35:56.680 --> 36:01.200
useful configuration. We have our sort of

36:01.200 --> 36:04.840
basic approach in putting this prototype

36:04.840 --> 36:07.420
together is we want to require minimal

36:07.420 --> 36:09.580
overhead for filing. You should be able to

36:09.580 --> 36:11.920
get documents into this collection with as

36:11.920 --> 36:14.960
little effort as possible. And you'll see

36:14.960 --> 36:18.240
concretely what that means. And then we

36:18.240 --> 36:20.320
want to provide, once you've gotten your

36:20.320 --> 36:22.620
document in there, and particularly if

36:22.620 --> 36:24.040
you've put your document in with very,

36:24.100 --> 36:27.020
very minimal coding of any kind, we want

36:27.020 --> 36:29.640
to give you multiple opportunities to add

36:29.640 --> 36:34.220
more metadata to the document. So we want

36:34.220 --> 36:36.300
you to be able to take a document that's

36:36.300 --> 36:37.880
in the, when you come across a document

36:37.880 --> 36:39.900
that's in the collection, be able to add

36:39.900 --> 36:42.680
more metadata to it if you're inspired to

36:42.680 --> 36:45.760
do that. And very importantly, as you'll

36:45.760 --> 36:49.140
see, the collection of metadata that's

36:49.140 --> 36:51.900
applicable has got to be modifiable.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.100
You've got to be able to both go in and

36:54.100 --> 36:55.840
change the coding of a particular document

36:55.840 --> 36:58.520
and then work with the overall set of

36:58.520 --> 37:00.480
metadata. data. And then when it goes to

37:00.480 --> 37:02.700
look to come sign to look for documents we

37:02.700 --> 37:04.740
want there to be multiple ways that you

37:04.740 --> 37:07.520
can go about looking for them. Trying to

37:07.520 --> 37:10.540
perpetuate some of the advantages of the

37:10.540 --> 37:13.560
paper world where where you can use a

37:13.560 --> 37:17.100
pretty wide repertoire of strategies for

37:17.100 --> 37:21.500
looking. The basic scenario has been that

37:21.500 --> 37:22.780
you know first of all you get your

37:22.780 --> 37:27.000
document scanned into into a file and and

37:27.000 --> 37:29.120
then into a repository. And then, of

37:29.120 --> 37:31.140
course, the rationale is that once you've

37:31.140 --> 37:34.460
got your documents online, you can do

37:34.460 --> 37:37.940
things like do multiple categorization of

37:37.940 --> 37:39.440
a given document. You don't have to worry

37:39.440 --> 37:41.140
about resolving those problems that Dave

37:41.140 --> 37:43.620
was struggling with. You can look at the

37:43.620 --> 37:45.700
whole collection in different ways, which

37:45.700 --> 37:47.280
is something that's impossible for them to

37:47.280 --> 37:49.120
do at this point. So you can look at the

37:49.120 --> 37:51.520
whole collection ordered by the document

37:51.520 --> 37:54.980
dates or the topics. And I'll show you

37:54.980 --> 37:58.760
more about that. you can still view and

37:58.760 --> 38:00.860
browse over the page images. That's a

38:00.860 --> 38:02.980
place where we want to preserve what

38:02.980 --> 38:05.160
you've got now and maybe even enhance it

38:05.160 --> 38:08.800
in some ways. Obviously now you can do a

38:08.800 --> 38:12.200
full text search over the optically

38:12.200 --> 38:16.060
character recognized text and we want you

38:16.060 --> 38:18.300
to be able to do combined searches so you

38:18.300 --> 38:20.340
throw in you know something that you know

38:20.340 --> 38:22.180
about a property that might have been

38:22.180 --> 38:24.300
assigned to this document with a text

38:24.300 --> 38:27.020
stream string and also being able to

38:27.020 --> 38:29.700
search use the images as a resource and

38:29.700 --> 38:32.620
then obviously once you're online there's

38:32.620 --> 38:34.360
the possibility of having distributed

38:34.360 --> 38:36.700
access to the collection so to sit at your

38:36.700 --> 38:38.660
desk and and over the world wide web

38:38.660 --> 38:40.320
actually look at it and get a hold of

38:40.320 --> 38:42.640
things and then you still have to be able

38:42.640 --> 38:44.560
to print your documents that's essential

38:44.560 --> 38:49.300
you know the idea there's simple idea we

38:49.300 --> 38:51.560
have is okay once Once you got documents

38:51.560 --> 38:56.460
online, then you could have access to the

38:56.460 --> 38:58.300
project files from multiple locations,

38:58.460 --> 39:00.100
from multiple locations both within

39:00.100 --> 39:03.200
Caltrans headquarters and also now they've

39:03.200 --> 39:04.860
got their field office set up out by the

39:04.860 --> 39:06.520
bridge. So one of the things we're

39:06.520 --> 39:08.460
interested in seeing is how do documents

39:08.460 --> 39:11.700
travel across these sites. The way they

39:11.700 --> 39:13.920
travel now primarily is that Dave gets a

39:13.920 --> 39:17.180
phone call, he or somebody who who works

39:17.180 --> 39:18.640
for him finds the document, they stick it

39:18.640 --> 39:20.620
into a relevant form of mail and it gets

39:20.620 --> 39:23.880
sent off or it gets faxed. So this would

39:23.880 --> 39:25.560
obviously open up some new possibilities

39:25.560 --> 39:28.900
there. And distributed access would work

39:28.900 --> 39:31.920
both to give multiple people access to the

39:31.920 --> 39:34.000
same collection as which is the situation

39:34.000 --> 39:36.820
I was just describing and also a single

39:36.820 --> 39:38.560
person, one of the managers that we've

39:38.560 --> 39:40.500
been talking to, she has I think a hundred

39:40.500 --> 39:42.440
projects that she's in principle

39:42.440 --> 39:45.040
responsible for. So she has an interest in

39:45.040 --> 39:47.120
being able to get views onto multiple

39:47.120 --> 39:50.680
project files. And there are really

39:50.680 --> 39:53.140
interesting, obviously, protection and

39:53.140 --> 39:56.000
access issues that come up there that I'll

39:56.000 --> 39:57.760
come back to. So what we've done is we've

39:57.760 --> 40:00.800
set up, this is the prototype. It's made

40:00.800 --> 40:04.680
up of plastic hardware software and paper.

40:05.780 --> 40:09.320
So we basically have a really, I will say,

40:09.360 --> 40:12.180
really nice Xerox scanner. Nice because it

40:12.180 --> 40:14.200
has a great document feeder so you can

40:14.200 --> 40:16.160
throw in multiple documents at a time.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.280
hooked up to a PC and the PC is running a

40:20.280 --> 40:22.600
piece of software called Pages, which

40:22.600 --> 40:24.480
again is a really nice application for

40:24.480 --> 40:27.620
supporting the work of scanning documents.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.440
And so the documents are basically scanned

40:32.440 --> 40:38.800
using the scanner in Pages onto the PC

40:38.800 --> 40:41.760
that's sitting there. And then with a web

40:41.760 --> 40:44.140
-based form, they're coded and then

40:44.140 --> 40:47.600
they're uploaded onto the web. And at the

40:47.600 --> 40:50.640
moment, they're actually uploaded onto the

40:50.640 --> 40:53.100
web and sent to PARC, where we pull them

40:53.100 --> 40:56.900
in across the PARC firewall and do various

40:56.900 --> 40:59.520
kinds of processing over them, and then

40:59.520 --> 41:02.000
put them back out, indexed, both the

41:02.000 --> 41:04.180
documents and the metadata indexed outside

41:04.180 --> 41:06.200
the firewall, so that people at Caltrans

41:06.200 --> 41:08.980
with password protection can view the

41:08.980 --> 41:10.720
documents. The thing that we're up to now

41:10.720 --> 41:12.240
is trying to move the whole thing into

41:12.240 --> 41:14.980
Caltrans running on their intranet. And

41:14.980 --> 41:18.100
that involves a bit of substituting some

41:18.100 --> 41:21.160
code that's been running at PARC with

41:21.160 --> 41:24.540
commercially available, extended

41:24.540 --> 41:27.420
commercially available software using

41:27.420 --> 41:31.560
pages as the sort of basic platform for

41:31.560 --> 41:35.460
it. They now have an intern who's

41:35.460 --> 41:38.560
dedicated 25 hours a week to scanning and

41:38.560 --> 41:41.940
maintaining the project files. We have at

41:41.940 --> 41:44.500
last count about 1,250 documents in there,

41:44.640 --> 41:47.060
which just to give you a sense, I mean if

41:47.060 --> 41:49.300
you say documents, it turns out documents

41:49.300 --> 41:51.740
average about five pages. That of course

41:51.740 --> 41:53.180
doesn't mean at all, I mean they range

41:53.180 --> 41:55.600
from lots of one pagers to long documents,

41:55.740 --> 41:59.400
but it's about 1,250 roughly times five is

41:59.400 --> 42:01.120
the number of actual pages that we have.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.800
And for those of you who are interested in

42:03.800 --> 42:05.980
it takes about a gigabyte of storage at

42:05.980 --> 42:08.080
this point with another megabyte for the

42:08.080 --> 42:08.580
metadata.

42:11.900 --> 42:14.580
Okay, some things that we've learned about

42:14.580 --> 42:17.400
scanning because along with the intern

42:17.400 --> 42:19.880
that they've hired, we ourselves have done

42:19.880 --> 42:22.080
an enormous amount of scanning and learned

42:22.080 --> 42:25.660
a great deal from it. You know, again this

42:25.660 --> 42:27.140
sort of goes back to what I was saying

42:27.140 --> 42:28.780
about filing. There are all these things

42:28.780 --> 42:32.140
that are almost too mundane to mention,

42:32.280 --> 42:33.700
but when you're actually sitting there

42:33.700 --> 42:35.320
scanning documents, they become quite

42:35.320 --> 42:38.860
salient. Things like you have a stack and

42:38.860 --> 42:41.020
it's not always completely clear what

42:41.020 --> 42:43.080
should constitute a single document.

42:43.600 --> 42:47.280
Should this thing be scanned as a single

42:47.280 --> 42:50.340
document or as multiple documents? A

42:50.340 --> 42:52.260
little bit of judgment has to be exercised

42:52.260 --> 42:53.920
there. You know, you've got to give the

42:53.920 --> 42:56.420
document a name to store it on the hard

42:56.420 --> 42:59.240
drive on your PC, and so you've got to

42:59.240 --> 43:00.960
sort of come up with something, and it

43:00.960 --> 43:02.720
turns out that we display the names, and

43:02.720 --> 43:04.320
so it's actually useful if they say a

43:04.320 --> 43:06.780
little bit about the document. And then

43:06.780 --> 43:07.960
you've got to deal with the kind of

43:07.960 --> 43:09.680
heterogeneity that these documents have.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.340
For example, there are a lot of documents

43:12.340 --> 43:14.140
that have some pages, portrait, and some

43:14.140 --> 43:16.960
landscape. And, you know, there are issues

43:16.960 --> 43:18.880
there. You throw them all on the scanner.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.920
one of the really nice things that Pages

43:20.920 --> 43:23.700
does is you can view all of the thumbnails

43:23.700 --> 43:25.280
of all the documents that you've scanned

43:25.280 --> 43:27.980
and very easily rotate. So we go in and we

43:27.980 --> 43:29.840
rotate the documents so that when the

43:29.840 --> 43:31.440
thumbnails are displayed, everything will

43:31.440 --> 43:34.900
be nicely oriented in the right way, which

43:34.900 --> 43:36.500
is great for viewing the documents, but

43:36.500 --> 43:37.860
then of course when you're going to go to

43:37.860 --> 43:41.460
print them, you need to both reorient them

43:41.460 --> 43:43.500
and rescale them again. So there are

43:43.500 --> 43:46.020
translations between scanning and viewing

43:46.020 --> 43:48.560
and printing around page orientation that

43:48.560 --> 43:51.640
have become an issue. And there are

43:51.640 --> 43:54.120
variously sized pages. Pages again

43:54.120 --> 43:56.120
supports really nicely, you know, you do

43:56.120 --> 43:58.820
the 8.5 by 11s and then you add the, you

43:58.820 --> 44:00.480
do the others on the platen and you add

44:00.480 --> 44:03.540
them. So a lot of this, and again, it's

44:03.540 --> 44:06.140
essential to be able to easily go in and

44:06.140 --> 44:09.020
re-scan a document, replace a particular

44:09.020 --> 44:11.720
page and also to see what you've done

44:11.720 --> 44:13.540
after you scan them and to be able to go

44:13.540 --> 44:16.600
in there and reorder pages reorient things

44:16.600 --> 44:19.380
all of that actually pages does really

44:19.380 --> 44:22.420
well which is why we're we're relying on

44:22.420 --> 44:25.080
it to a great deal now of course you get

44:25.080 --> 44:27.020
to the documents in the project files

44:27.020 --> 44:30.700
through a home page and we have this

44:30.700 --> 44:34.500
project files home page it may be a little

44:34.500 --> 44:36.380
hard for you to read it so you know you

44:36.380 --> 44:38.200
can select search the project files that

44:38.200 --> 44:39.580
which takes you to the search interface

44:39.580 --> 44:41.660
which I'll show you add a new document

44:41.660 --> 44:43.920
takes you to the coding form that I'll

44:43.920 --> 44:46.140
show you and then a very various ways in

44:46.140 --> 44:48.040
which you can review the whole collection

44:48.040 --> 44:52.140
by dates by the arranged according to the

44:52.140 --> 44:58.620
uniform filing system and then various

44:58.620 --> 45:00.820
kinds of administrative operations that it

45:00.820 --> 45:02.460
turns out to be really useful to have like

45:02.460 --> 45:05.240
a change log that shows what the status of

45:05.240 --> 45:08.120
documents that have been scanned but not

45:08.120 --> 45:12.160
yet indexed is and things like that. We

45:12.160 --> 45:16.160
have a web-based form so that after you've

45:16.160 --> 45:18.740
used Pages to scan your document, you go

45:18.740 --> 45:22.240
in and you bring it up and then you can

45:22.240 --> 45:26.260
code it in a variety of ways. The

45:26.260 --> 45:29.060
interesting thing about this form is the

45:29.060 --> 45:31.540
number of times it's changed since we've

45:31.540 --> 45:34.260
been working with them. Once they really

45:34.260 --> 45:37.940
got into using this form, they began to

45:37.940 --> 45:40.740
see ways in which actually the initial

45:40.740 --> 45:44.040
things which they said made sense. Like we

45:44.040 --> 45:46.000
started out with a bunch of keywords,

45:46.160 --> 45:48.080
which then got differentiated into things

45:48.080 --> 45:49.980
like source and recipient, as we have

45:49.980 --> 45:52.980
here. And the issue there is that it's

45:52.980 --> 45:55.940
become clear to us how essential it is

45:55.940 --> 45:58.320
that this kind of a form be tailorable and

45:58.320 --> 46:01.260
modifiable. And that presents, we've

46:01.260 --> 46:03.260
probably done a half a dozen iterations on

46:03.260 --> 46:05.720
the design of this form in the last six

46:05.720 --> 46:07.040
months to a year that we've been working

46:07.040 --> 46:10.320
with them. This poses a real challenge for

46:10.320 --> 46:12.480
us in attempting to move this thing into

46:12.480 --> 46:14.140
their environment and extricate ourselves

46:14.140 --> 46:16.260
because at the moment these changes are

46:16.260 --> 46:17.920
done through very close collaboration

46:17.920 --> 46:21.980
between the engineers and Randy where they

46:21.980 --> 46:24.120
tell him the changes that they want and he

46:24.120 --> 46:26.660
implements them. How do we deal with that?

46:26.780 --> 46:28.320
That's obviously going to be essential.

46:29.680 --> 46:33.080
Once you've coded your document, you go

46:33.080 --> 46:36.080
down. This is the second page which

46:36.080 --> 46:37.940
printed out doesn't fit onto a single

46:37.940 --> 46:40.720
sheet. You go down to the bottom and you

46:40.720 --> 46:45.720
say submit document and document info. And

46:45.720 --> 46:47.560
then it goes through this, at the moment,

46:47.620 --> 46:50.680
this sort of trip over to park and back

46:50.680 --> 46:54.180
again. But eventually that will just

46:54.180 --> 46:57.700
basically put it onto a web server in

46:57.700 --> 47:01.460
their environment. Again, some

47:01.460 --> 47:04.220
observations about coding documents, which

47:04.220 --> 47:06.460
we've also done a lot of and talked to

47:06.460 --> 47:10.040
them about a lot. It turns out that

47:10.040 --> 47:13.320
there's a requirement for a lot of

47:13.320 --> 47:15.560
flexibility around the question of who

47:15.560 --> 47:17.520
codes documents and who scans them. And

47:17.520 --> 47:19.720
one of the things that they wanted and

47:19.720 --> 47:21.960
that we provided is a paper version of the

47:21.960 --> 47:24.700
online coding form. Which means that

47:24.700 --> 47:27.340
engineers who are sitting at their desks

47:27.340 --> 47:29.540
with a pile of documents can just take

47:29.540 --> 47:32.820
this paper form, code it, paper clip it to

47:32.820 --> 47:34.280
the front of the document, put it in that

47:34.280 --> 47:36.540
inbox, and then the intern can scan it.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.580
The intern also does coding himself

47:38.580 --> 47:39.820
online.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.860
Engineers could do online coding from

47:43.860 --> 47:45.800
their desks if they were into that. But

47:45.800 --> 47:48.440
basically, it's the more alternatives

47:48.440 --> 47:50.820
there are for how to do this, the better.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.960
Again, a lot of flexibility in the amount

47:53.960 --> 47:56.180
of coding. Either you can do very, very

47:56.180 --> 47:59.020
minimal coding, basically give it a

47:59.020 --> 48:01.520
uniform file system category, or you can

48:01.520 --> 48:03.920
do increasingly elaborate, and you can do

48:03.920 --> 48:05.800
that either at the time that you scan it

48:05.800 --> 48:08.440
or later. So we've been trying to give

48:08.440 --> 48:12.900
them a lot of different ways of organizing

48:12.900 --> 48:17.120
the time and the place and how much or

48:17.120 --> 48:19.060
little of this work gets done and that

48:19.060 --> 48:20.860
seems essential for making the thing

48:20.860 --> 48:24.860
really, really useful, usable and useful.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.260
Again, now that things, once things have

48:29.260 --> 48:32.340
actually been entered into the online

48:32.340 --> 48:35.260
repository, there are a whole lot of new

48:35.260 --> 48:37.420
ways to be able to see the collection. You

48:37.420 --> 48:39.520
can still look at all of the, look at the

48:39.520 --> 48:41.100
collection according to the uniform filing

48:41.100 --> 48:43.800
system, but now, oh sorry, I meant to put

48:43.800 --> 48:46.760
this one up for you, but now of course you

48:46.760 --> 48:50.980
have active links. So you can actually go

48:50.980 --> 48:53.120
in and you can see how many documents

48:53.120 --> 48:54.800
there are in a given category. You can

48:54.800 --> 48:56.600
click on the link and you can see all of

48:56.600 --> 48:59.540
those documents. So it's preserving the

48:59.540 --> 49:03.020
old way of organizing the collection, but

49:03.020 --> 49:05.420
with some new ways of being able to see it

49:05.420 --> 49:09.240
and get at it. One thing that's turned out

49:09.240 --> 49:11.060
to be really useful for them is that you

49:11.060 --> 49:12.540
can organize, you can see the whole

49:12.540 --> 49:15.080
collection ordered by dates from the most

49:15.080 --> 49:18.240
recent documents. It turns out that in

49:18.240 --> 49:20.720
thinking about a document when people,

49:20.740 --> 49:22.320
when they're going to look for it, people

49:22.320 --> 49:25.180
very often know, well you know this is a

49:25.180 --> 49:27.360
letter that was sent to us back in March

49:27.360 --> 49:30.380
of last year. So it's really helpful to be

49:30.380 --> 49:32.040
able to go in and look at all the

49:32.040 --> 49:36.080
documents from March of last year. You can

49:36.080 --> 49:39.520
actually view thumbnail images of all of

49:39.520 --> 49:41.540
the, some of the document, one of the

49:41.540 --> 49:43.520
options is to code documents by the type

49:43.520 --> 49:45.360
of document they are. So is it a letter,

49:45.420 --> 49:49.100
is it a report, is it a memo, and you can

49:49.100 --> 49:52.000
again just see see what you've got in the

49:52.000 --> 49:55.160
collection in that way. In addition to

49:55.160 --> 49:58.020
various ways of viewing it, obviously you

49:58.020 --> 49:59.580
can you can search and And this is the

49:59.580 --> 50:02.260
kind of, it's a hybrid search interface,

50:02.380 --> 50:03.860
as I said, because it allows you to

50:03.860 --> 50:06.980
combine a full-text search with properties

50:06.980 --> 50:11.600
plus getting back a view of your hits as

50:11.600 --> 50:14.860
thumbnails, which you can then scan in

50:14.860 --> 50:16.540
something like the way that you would scan

50:16.540 --> 50:20.380
a paper collection. And you can also

50:20.380 --> 50:23.420
display the returns, the results of a

50:23.420 --> 50:24.980
search in different ways. You can display

50:24.980 --> 50:27.160
them as thumbnails. you can also display

50:27.160 --> 50:29.500
them in this kind of tabular form if it's

50:29.500 --> 50:31.440
more helpful to see everything that comes

50:31.440 --> 50:33.780
back by date. So again, the point here is

50:33.780 --> 50:36.860
that there are many different combination

50:36.860 --> 50:39.060
ways in which things can be configured.

50:39.460 --> 50:41.700
And it turns out that how you want it

50:41.700 --> 50:44.580
configured is very much tied to what you

50:44.580 --> 50:47.360
know when you go to do the search. It

50:47.360 --> 50:49.960
shapes how you want to actually view the

50:49.960 --> 50:54.060
collection. Once you find a document that

50:54.060 --> 50:58.920
you're looking for, you can view it in

50:58.920 --> 51:01.960
multiple thumbnail sizes. So here's a

51:01.960 --> 51:04.560
single document with all of its pages laid

51:04.560 --> 51:06.960
out. You can see this issue of portrait

51:06.960 --> 51:09.580
and landscape in a single document. And

51:09.580 --> 51:12.920
then of course you can go in and view any

51:12.920 --> 51:14.920
of the pages. And you can see from this

51:14.920 --> 51:16.860
how important the images are because a lot

51:16.860 --> 51:19.060
of the documents in this collection, once

51:19.060 --> 51:21.700
you do OCR, you get back practically

51:21.700 --> 51:24.180
nothing. And even the documents that you

51:24.180 --> 51:27.060
get a lot back from OCR have in addition

51:27.060 --> 51:29.880
various kinds of marginalia annotations

51:29.880 --> 51:32.720
that you lose. So we're very much

51:32.720 --> 51:35.480
believers in the idea that you need to

51:35.480 --> 51:38.420
preserve images as well as providing

51:38.420 --> 51:42.860
people with text search. And then Randy

51:42.860 --> 51:45.240
has actually created, in an attempt to

51:45.240 --> 51:47.600
address this problem of user modification

51:47.600 --> 51:51.100
of the coding scheme, Randy's actually

51:51.100 --> 51:55.120
provided an interface for them that allows

51:55.120 --> 51:57.280
them to do the relatively straightforward

51:57.280 --> 51:59.500
things like take all the documents that

51:59.500 --> 52:01.760
were called this and now call them that,

52:01.960 --> 52:06.700
or add this new category. The tricky part,

52:06.780 --> 52:08.760
of course, that we're dealing with now is

52:08.760 --> 52:11.720
they do more elaborate reconfigurations of

52:11.720 --> 52:14.020
their coding scheme that have

52:14.020 --> 52:16.560
ramifications back through the already

52:16.560 --> 52:18.980
coded documents, Randy has to write more

52:18.980 --> 52:20.800
and more elaborate scripts that will go

52:20.800 --> 52:24.240
back and and recode the collection. And

52:24.900 --> 52:27.680
the really difficult question that we face

52:27.680 --> 52:30.960
is when we leave, how can we make sure

52:30.960 --> 52:33.320
that this thing doesn't die in the next,

52:33.380 --> 52:35.340
at the next point where they decide they

52:35.340 --> 52:37.660
want to to make a big change and aren't

52:37.660 --> 52:39.500
able to do it. That's and that's that

52:39.500 --> 52:41.200
brings us into the whole question of what

52:41.200 --> 52:44.760
kind of continuing organizational and

52:44.760 --> 52:48.320
human support there's going to be. Okay,

52:48.420 --> 52:53.340
to summarize, the two aspects of what this

52:53.340 --> 52:55.740
project has meant in terms of designing,

52:56.100 --> 52:59.220
there's the project of configuring a

52:59.220 --> 53:00.960
working prototype, which we've done by,

53:01.080 --> 53:02.520
you know, we got a first approximation

53:02.520 --> 53:05.460
running in our lab. We moved it over to

53:05.460 --> 53:07.780
their organization, keeping some of the

53:07.780 --> 53:10.760
processing work at PARC, and now we're

53:10.760 --> 53:12.320
trying to actually move the whole thing

53:12.320 --> 53:16.780
onto their intranet. And then a lot of

53:16.780 --> 53:18.700
what we've been doing has been configuring

53:18.700 --> 53:21.540
a working practice in relation to that

53:21.540 --> 53:24.340
prototype, working out flexible divisions

53:24.340 --> 53:27.080
of labor. As I said, this idea of paper

53:27.080 --> 53:30.640
coding forms came out of that. that. Being

53:30.640 --> 53:34.120
sure that you can review and manipulate

53:34.120 --> 53:36.280
your page images. It's just you can't,

53:36.280 --> 53:39.580
scanning really requires, you can't do it

53:39.580 --> 53:41.400
blind. You want to see what you've done

53:41.400 --> 53:42.900
and you want to be able to go in there and

53:42.900 --> 53:46.660
fix things. And support for this kind of

53:46.660 --> 53:48.860
iterative document coding. So you code a

53:48.860 --> 53:50.880
document maybe a bit when you scan it and

53:50.880 --> 53:52.600
then you add things or you change things

53:52.600 --> 53:54.740
later on. Maybe even when you go to search

53:54.740 --> 53:56.060
for it and you bring it up and you see how

53:56.060 --> 53:57.540
it was coded and you say, oh, I don't

53:57.540 --> 54:00.420
really like that. I want to revise it. And

54:00.420 --> 54:03.940
then on a larger scale, support for this

54:03.940 --> 54:06.580
kind of extensible and modifiable metadata

54:06.580 --> 54:09.900
that seems so important. Some of the

54:09.900 --> 54:16.100
issues for them, if this effort is

54:16.100 --> 54:19.380
successful, is that if we were actually to

54:19.380 --> 54:21.160
get to the point where this collection was

54:21.160 --> 54:23.500
online and available in a distributed way,

54:23.700 --> 54:26.840
the project team is no longer the

54:26.840 --> 54:28.500
interface to the collection in the way

54:28.500 --> 54:29.820
that they have been before, which has

54:29.820 --> 54:32.980
afforded tremendous value in various ways.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.800
I mean these documents are in principle

54:35.800 --> 54:40.040
available to anyone, but of course it's a

54:40.040 --> 54:42.060
big difference if you, if all of the

54:42.060 --> 54:45.640
requests go through you or if people in

54:45.640 --> 54:48.480
unknown places are doing unknown things

54:48.480 --> 54:50.700
with the collection. So access controls

54:50.700 --> 54:54.020
that now are largely taken care of through

54:54.020 --> 54:56.100
the practicalities of the medium because

54:56.100 --> 54:58.300
these things exist in one place nobody

54:58.300 --> 55:00.340
else knows how to find anything in them

55:00.340 --> 55:02.900
now have to be addressed much more

55:02.900 --> 55:07.780
explicitly and very important and very

55:07.780 --> 55:10.480
salient for us at the moment is where of

55:10.480 --> 55:12.620
course at this point we're keeping all of

55:12.620 --> 55:15.220
these documents on on paper in the old

55:15.220 --> 55:18.660
way. Eventually, I would imagine there

55:18.660 --> 55:21.560
would be some mix. A lot of them would no

55:21.560 --> 55:23.860
longer be kept in the binders once they

55:23.860 --> 55:26.420
were online. Others of them would be kept

55:26.420 --> 55:27.860
in the binders because you'd want the

55:27.860 --> 55:30.240
original for various reasons. And so there

55:30.240 --> 55:33.380
are very complicated questions about how

55:33.380 --> 55:35.700
you're going to maintain the coherence of

55:35.700 --> 55:38.900
the media of the paper and the digital

55:38.900 --> 55:41.440
renderings of the documents. And then

55:41.440 --> 55:43.640
finally, this larger question of

55:43.640 --> 55:46.960
maintaining the coherence of your coding

55:46.960 --> 55:50.280
categories, both with respect to the paper

55:50.280 --> 55:52.860
and the digital documents, and how you do

55:52.860 --> 55:54.640
that both over time. We've already seen,

55:54.720 --> 55:56.680
as I said, tremendously dynamic changes

55:56.680 --> 55:58.840
there within the project team that we're

55:58.840 --> 56:01.180
working with over the year or so that

56:01.180 --> 56:03.160
we've had the prototype running. And then

56:03.160 --> 56:05.620
once you have multiple project teams

56:05.620 --> 56:08.660
working with a collection, it becomes an

56:08.660 --> 56:11.580
even more challenging kind of coordination

56:11.580 --> 56:19.200
problem. I'll end with a slogan, which is

56:19.200 --> 56:21.240
really a slogan that refers to this whole

56:21.240 --> 56:23.680
approach to doing this kind of work

56:23.680 --> 56:26.600
oriented design approach. I was often

56:26.600 --> 56:29.980
asked, well the impression I got from many

56:29.980 --> 56:32.400
of my colleagues at PARCC in the early

56:32.400 --> 56:34.140
days when I was arguing for this kind of

56:34.140 --> 56:37.720
work was, is if we go out and look at the

56:37.720 --> 56:39.980
way people are currently working, it will

56:39.980 --> 56:43.980
have this deeply conservative effect on

56:43.980 --> 56:47.340
us. We'll end up just replicating what

56:47.340 --> 56:50.400
they're doing now. And it's better if we

56:50.400 --> 56:53.520
just sort of freely imagine the

56:53.520 --> 56:58.240
possibilities. And my response to that is,

56:58.300 --> 57:02.160
well, if you, in a very sort of flat

57:02.160 --> 57:05.100
-footed way, went about trying to

57:05.100 --> 57:07.020
replicate exactly, well first of all I

57:07.020 --> 57:09.840
think the premise that there is that until

57:09.840 --> 57:14.040
we as designers come along the world is a

57:14.040 --> 57:16.820
stagnant place. That people are basically

57:16.820 --> 57:18.500
sitting there doing the same thing over

57:18.500 --> 57:19.820
and over again and it's only when

57:19.820 --> 57:22.160
brilliant and innovative designers come on

57:22.160 --> 57:23.860
the scene that they say oh you know we

57:23.860 --> 57:25.580
could be doing it differently. That's not

57:25.580 --> 57:27.520
my experience. Every workplace I've ever

57:27.520 --> 57:29.780
been in there are people in the the

57:29.780 --> 57:32.860
workplace who, not everyone, but there are

57:32.860 --> 57:35.420
always people who are pretty continually

57:35.420 --> 57:38.380
sort of reflecting in, you know, greater

57:38.380 --> 57:39.760
and lesser ways about what they're doing

57:39.760 --> 57:41.340
and trying to figure out how to do it

57:41.340 --> 57:43.940
differently. And our experience is that

57:43.940 --> 57:46.080
it's much more that it's hard to keep up

57:46.080 --> 57:50.700
with the dynamism of the organization of

57:50.700 --> 57:52.920
work practices than it is to get people

57:52.920 --> 57:56.420
to, you know, sort of get, make any kinds

57:56.420 --> 58:00.020
of changes in what they're doing. So first

58:00.020 --> 58:02.260
of all, things aren't stagnant until we

58:02.260 --> 58:05.040
come along. And secondly, if we did come

58:05.040 --> 58:09.620
along and try to take an analysis of

58:09.620 --> 58:11.260
people's working practices as the basis

58:11.260 --> 58:14.260
for design, in the absence of any sort of

58:14.260 --> 58:18.260
imaginative activity, we might have a

58:18.260 --> 58:21.840
problem. We need to also engage in

58:21.840 --> 58:23.900
thinking about how things could be

58:23.900 --> 58:27.140
different. But the idea here is that, I

58:27.140 --> 58:28.800
mean the crude way of putting this is it's

58:28.800 --> 58:30.620
better to design from knowledge than from

58:30.620 --> 58:33.040
ignorance, right? But I think that the

58:33.040 --> 58:38.660
goal that we're after is to try to get

58:38.660 --> 58:42.580
enough of a mutual understanding, and this

58:42.580 --> 58:44.480
comes very much out of the tradition of

58:44.480 --> 58:46.520
Scandinavian systems design that we've

58:46.520 --> 58:49.000
been deeply influenced by. The idea that

58:49.000 --> 58:51.420
people doing a particular kind of work

58:51.420 --> 58:54.640
using relevant technologies need to have

58:54.640 --> 58:56.060
enough of an understanding of what the

58:56.060 --> 58:58.400
technological possibilities are that they

58:58.400 --> 59:02.360
can engage in thinking intelligently about

59:02.360 --> 59:04.280
what the possibilities could be. And

59:04.280 --> 59:06.960
that's what our running prototype in this

59:06.960 --> 59:09.780
worksite is doing. It's giving people in

59:09.780 --> 59:12.940
the worksite the ability to imagine what

59:12.940 --> 59:14.800
the technology, to have enough of an

59:14.800 --> 59:16.300
understanding of what the technology does

59:16.300 --> 59:17.880
to be able to imagine what it could do.

59:18.060 --> 59:20.980
And similarly for us, we need not to

59:20.980 --> 59:22.820
become civil engineers. That would be, you

59:22.820 --> 59:25.120
know, that would require many lifetimes to

59:25.120 --> 59:27.520
do that in all of the sites where we might

59:27.520 --> 59:30.400
want to design. But we need to develop

59:30.400 --> 59:32.420
enough of an appreciation for what their

59:32.420 --> 59:35.720
issues are that we in turn can think

59:35.720 --> 59:38.640
intelligently about their work. And doing

59:38.640 --> 59:40.960
the kind of projects that we're doing on

59:40.960 --> 59:42.540
site in the way that we're doing them

59:42.540 --> 59:47.100
enables that sort of collaboration so that

59:47.100 --> 59:48.780
you get what I think is a very powerful

59:48.780 --> 59:53.020
combination of grounded understanding of

59:53.020 --> 59:57.820
existing practice plus imagination of how

59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.720
things might be different. So I'll stop

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.820
there and take questions. Yeah? What are

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.580
your thoughts at the moment on purging and

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.140
on archiving machinery in the form of

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:12.520
this?

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.380
Well, if we get to stay around long enough

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.500
we'll see because in terms of archiving

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:27.180
it's a very explicit part of this project

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.940
files process that a subset of the

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.900
documents in the project files go into a

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.760
history file. In paper? In paper. Now at

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760
the moment everything is in paper. But

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760
that means that if we have an online

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.440
collection, eventually a subset of that

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.940
online collection will need to be archived

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:49.800
and another, presumably some other

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.100
documents that are useful in the course of

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.880
the project will no longer be needed. I

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.860
have an article in the media that I've

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.180
read very recently about the fact that

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.980
even DVDs are now known to deteriorate

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.620
much more rapidly than anyone expected

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.400
they would. Much faster than film, for

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.480
example. And now this is a more general

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.440
question to someone from PARC. What are

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.980
you going to use to archive records? Yeah,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.040
I am not an archivist, but I think that, I

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.340
know that's a really serious and pressing

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:23.900
question, because archivists know a lot

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.900
about paper as a medium. And there's been

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.340
a huge amount of work done to develop

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.740
kinds of paper that are extremely durable,

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.400
much more than we know or have done in

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.060
relation to digital media. So I don't have

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.180
the answer, but I think it's a very

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.560
important question. Yeah. Have you looked

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.780
at the change in practice after

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.660
introduction of your prototype? You have a

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.920
fascinating natural experiment. Any result

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.080
coming in? Oh, yeah. I mean, well, let's

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.980
see. Obviously, before we were there, the

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.960
practice was to take these documents and

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.360
put them into the binders. And we've

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:06.920
interjected an entire new sort of piece of

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.700
work that we hope is going to be valuable

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:13.180
enough. that it's worth doing. At the

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.260
moment, of course, they're doing both

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.240
things so that after things are put into

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.940
the online collection they get put into

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.660
the binders. I think it's,

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.760
we've actually wondered what would be

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.220
happening if we weren't there because the

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:34.420
state of the documents that needed to go

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.700
into the project files was reaching kind

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.620
of a crisis point at the time when we

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.060
actually got our prototype up and running.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.140
I mean, there were just stacks of

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.720
documents everywhere. It was out of

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.280
control in part because the whole project

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.600
is on an accelerated timeframe and there's

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.200
nobody to do that work. So partly I think

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.680
our being there, this is a bit of a

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.660
Hawthorne effect, but it's had now I think

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.820
some really enduring consequences, was to

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.440
raise the project files to both to raise

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.940
their visibility within the team and also

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.380
you know we obviously put we've put a lot

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.720
of labor into getting getting the online

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.000
collection together I think what what

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.720
usually happens around the project files

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.820
is that they are they're managed on it on

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.900
an as-needed basis so for a large part of

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.700
the project people go along doing sort of

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.200
crisis is document search. They need to

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.980
find something, they spend huge amounts of

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.020
time searching through piles of documents.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.080
And then at the point where they're

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.700
actually responsible for turning the

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.960
collection over to someone else, they do a

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.400
huge amount of work to pull the collection

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.320
together. So the collection becomes more

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.340
like a record than a useful resource in

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.960
the actual work as it's going on. So I'm

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.160
hoping that one of the effects of our

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.940
intervention is to make the project files

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.820
into much more of a sort of active

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.220
resource and obviously cut down a great

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.440
deal on the amount of time they spend

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.020
searching through cardboard boxes and all

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.120
the other stacks of things that are

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.980
around. Yeah. Two questions. A lot of

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.820
times people take old documents and modify

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.620
them, either clipping notes to them or

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.660
making changes to them. How do you handle

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.640
that in the system? Are there multiple

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.440
copies of the document, links or what?

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.400
There are multiple copies, multiple

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.840
versions of documents, and in a way that's

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.300
fine. We don't worry. We've tried to keep

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.440
an eye out for exact duplicates and not

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.460
put exact duplicates in. But we've got

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.560
many variations on documents with

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.060
different annotations. And I think one of

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.300
the benefits of this kind of a system is

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:52.360
that you can do that at a relatively low

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.100
cost. And then when you do your search,

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.420
you're going to get back all of the

01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.380
different versions, and you can look for

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.980
the one that you want. It's really up to

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.360
them to decide which documents go into the

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.340
collection. So I would say if something

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:12.300
gets pulled out and modified, it's going

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.940
to be their call whether it should then be

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.480
rescanned in a new version. But we want to

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.440
make the scanning easy enough that if you

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.360
wanted to do that, it wouldn't be a big

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.200
deal. The second question is with the

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.080
changing of the classification, how much

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.960
of that is them learning the system and

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.260
thinking about it for the first time

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.600
versus they're moving on to different

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.840
phases of the work? I think partly it's

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.520
their thinking more about it. partly their

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.060
orientation to the classification scheme

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.760
is tied to the particular thing that

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.940
they're working on at the moment. For

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.140
example, we just had a major revision to

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.080
the filing system by one of the engineers

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.440
who was given responsibility for doing

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.900
some work around all of the task orders to

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.620
consultants. So he was focused on the task

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.240
orders to consultants. He looked at the

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.680
previous classification scheme and he

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.200
didn't like the ways in which, you know,

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.660
he was actually going to look for those

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.440
things and they were interspersed in ways

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.700
that he didn't like and he wanted to

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.900
create a new category for them. So it's

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.780
very much occasioned by you turn to do a

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:26.600
particular task and you then find things,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.300
you know, that matter to you. And I think

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.080
that kind of interweaving of the design of

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.980
the classification scheme and the the

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.620
ongoing work is critical. You've got to be

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.640
able to sort of work back and forth

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.620
between the two. It doesn't happen all at

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.380
once at the beginning. And it doesn't even

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.280
happen at sort of predictable times. It

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.640
happens as the spirit moves you and you

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.020
actually care, then you focus on it. Yeah?

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.380
Yeah. I noticed in my experience, if I

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:03.160
have some kind of archives, I put them on

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.720
my desk. so that I can remember that I

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.800
need to look at these things. I'm

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.760
wondering if you guys have thought about

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.880
that in terms of those documents are

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.860
actually a trigger to remember things. If

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.560
they're in some kind of electronic form,

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.600
it may not be as good a trigger. Right,

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.460
absolutely. I think the difference between

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.080
having things sort of enclosed in a

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.740
workstation and spread around is very

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.560
important. In a way, that's about how

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.180
things move between this sort of active

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:34.080
and working status. But I think there are

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.780
interesting possibilities, again, for new

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.560
kinds of integration there. I mean, one of

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.500
the things that people at PARCC have been

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.760
working on for a long time are these

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:49.620
glyphs, basically barcode-type images that

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.940
you could put onto documents that are

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.260
instructions for, you know, are machine

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:59.240
-readable. So one of the ideas is that you

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.080
could have, it's been called document

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.240
tokens, or let's say you have, I mean,

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.480
I've always thought it would be nice to

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.320
have paper file cabinets, but instead of

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.420
the whole papers, I'd have first pages.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.420
So, and then you could take out that page

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.400
and stick it into a scanner and get the

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.940
whole document back out again. So

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.580
variations on how we could both have those

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.840
sort of mnemonic cues, but maybe not have

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.140
in every case the whole document sitting

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.100
around, for example. So, but that kind of

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.540
playing with the relationship between the

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:36.180
paper and the digital, I think, is really

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.680
interesting. Much more interesting

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.820
direction than thinking about, you know,

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.060
the paperless office. I think it would be

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.820
interesting to see that. So, a lot of

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.860
people have personal post-it notes where

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:51.640
although the documents are shared between

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.020
everyone, when there's some kind of system

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.320
locally on their computer where they can

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.340
add post-it notes to the files that

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:59.300
represent their own files. Right. Well, if

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.080
we're imagining this as a web-based thing,

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.360
people should be able to create their own

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.220
sub-collections. People should be able to

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.620
have their own sets of bookmarks,

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.520
obviously, and do sort of personalized

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.440
subsets of the project files. We've got a

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.040
lot of post-its in the project files.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.040
We've been very conscientious about

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.200
scanning everything, right? So we scan

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.520
post-its, and sometimes if it's a post-it

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.740
that obscures the document, we'll do it

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.660
twice. So we'll have an image of the

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.140
document with the Post-it and then the

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.660
page behind it, right? But those sorts of

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.080
things, you know, we take those seriously.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:37.840
Yeah? Have you started to gather any

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.160
evidence on how people, without using both

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.340
the paper files and the online version,

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.940
are they starting, I mean, do you find

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:45.560
them turning to search in one or the

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.700
other? Yeah, I think it's too early to say

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.780
that. We've been so focused on building

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.140
this collection that we're just beginning.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.160
It's just now getting to the point where

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:59.260
it's substantial enough. And it's, I think

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.720
we're passing that threshold where we've

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.360
got enough documents in the collection and

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.800
it's going to be enough easier to find

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.480
things in the collection than on paper

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.900
that the search, you know, will really

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.780
start. But that's where we're focused at

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.800
the moment. And I think it's too soon to

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.500
say. we've gotten reports of you know I

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.660
found a document using your system that I

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.640
hadn't been able to find but the sense I

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.420
have is that it's still people probably go

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.760
first to look for the thing on paper and

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.360
then if they can't find it they go to the

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.260
system we really have to get the system at

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.400
much more sort of on people's desktops so

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.300
that you know what we would put a bookmark

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.440
on Dave's machine and and we've made

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.700
little cheat sheets about how easy it is

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.020
to do search. But people aren't quite into

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.180
it yet. They still view the intern as the

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.080
kind of, that they'll go to him and he'll

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.920
do an online search for them. So we're, I

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.420
think, very much still in that process.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.320
Right. Well, I think that's going to

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.220
depend on the document. In some cases, I

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.240
think they'll print it out. In some cases,

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.640
they'll want to go back and find the

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.540
original. Yeah. I saw images of drawing

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.480
CAD files. Right, they actually handle

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.080
their CAD files, their actual plans

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.760
separately from the project files at this

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.780
point. And so we don't have, we have some

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:32.720
printouts of plans that have some

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.660
historical relationship to the current

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.620
project, but their actual working CAD

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.420
files are treated totally separately and

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.340
and are much more at this point online

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:49.420
than the rest of these documents so not at

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.100
this point but that's going to be

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:57.200
important eventually to do that yeah you

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.020
have been mentioning that there is the

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.740
need a growing need to keep care of the

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.940
coding I mean they're kind of this I There

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.300
is a kind of these arrows of all this

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:08.980
stuff. And when the project gets larger,

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.200
do you foresee the need to have someone

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.320
taking care of these arrows and then

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.240
possibly undermining the economic benefits

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.980
of such a system? Or the benefits in terms

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.740
of, is that the engineers caring for these

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.020
arrows will overcome the fact that someone

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.920
will have to be professionally involved in

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.260
keeping these arrows? I do think that in

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.520
order to get the value from the system,

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.440
there will need to be some human resources

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.260
invested in, particularly in the ongoing

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.720
modification and maintenance of the

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.580
collection, the kinds of things where we

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.840
want to make a substantial enough change

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.280
to the classification scheme that

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.940
something's got to run over the collection

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.280
and bring it up to date. And I think that

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.820
is a new role that's really going to be

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.040
crucial, which I would see as a relatively

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.520
small investment that has the potential of

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.560
actually making the rest of the

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.320
investment, you know, pay off. But those

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.440
are the kinds of, I think, really hard

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:12.400
issues, practical issues around getting a

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.280
system like this really implemented in an

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.980
organization. Do you know if there was

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.160
someone in the past, before the cuts in

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.940
the budgets, that would do this work, so

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.740
the technology is bringing back a figure

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.020
that was there? Well, in a way, there is

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.240
a, for example, one of the engineers now

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.560
keeps a copy of the UFS. Actually, he uses

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.140
an Excel spreadsheet, which is

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.360
interesting. I'm not quite sure why, but I

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.040
think because he likes all the columns and

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.200
rows and everything. And he actually goes

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.820
in and edits that. And so what that would

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:51.420
mean now is you'd get your new uniform

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.120
filing system, and then you'd have to go

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.900
back and make sure your binders were, you

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.820
know, synchronized with that. So there is

01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.500
a kind of version of it now, but it

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.100
involves a very different set of skills.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.640
And, you know, we're talking about some

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.840
programming skills here that take you into

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.880
whole other departments, you know, then

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.080
you get into the information systems

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.440
department and you're into an entirely new

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.620
sort of place in the organization. So

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.940
it's, yeah. Have you found picking up on

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:20.060
that, have you found that formalizing the

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:23.120
work processes and workflows, roles of the

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.720
people help you in figuring out what kind

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.840
of coding system would be helpful for

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.000
work? My immediate answer is no. I guess I

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.900
should think about it a little bit more. I

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.300
mean, it's so dynamic. They're constantly

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.300
negotiating their sort of working division

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.160
of labor within the group. And I mean

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.380
there are frameworks that come down from

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.380
that centrally. There's a large procedure

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:52.500
manual for projects at Caltrans, which is

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.720
really a framework for here are the sort

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.400
of basic components of what needs to shape

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.340
a project. And then the lead engineers for

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.400
the individual projects have a huge amount

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.260
of discretion in the way that they

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.700
organize their particular team, and that's

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.580
changing all the time with the different

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.560
phases of the project as they see what's

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.760
working and what's not working. So I think

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.540
it's such a moving target that you know a

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.700
lot of what I've been talking about is

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.840
trying to provide a kind of toolkit or a

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.040
suite of resources that can be picked up

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.120
and combined and recombined very flexibly

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.760
and that that's essential because their

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.560
own division of labor and their roles and

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.740
the the organization of the work is so

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.680
dynamic. So I'm not, in this kind of

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.900
situation, I'm not much of a believer in,

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.400
well, some of you know I'm not much of a

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.100
believer in workflow, but definitely for

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:55.360
this kind of work site. I guess I was

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.000
thinking at the document level, thinking

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.660
about workflows and uses. That would help

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.200
you. And whether there is then some meta

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.480
-models that would emerge. Well, I think

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.120
the problem is that I think what you could

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.020
come up with would be very schematic. It

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.740
would be useful, but it would be very

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:15.740
schematic. And the actual use would take

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:20.200
you off into very sort of circumstantially

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.740
organized cases that I mean, you know, at

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:28.340
this point we haven't felt any need. I

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.600
mean, there are obviously, you could come

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.980
along and describe the organization of

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:37.440
work that that's been set up in in a model

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.740
but it's not clear to me what what value

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:40.700
it would have at this point.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:49.400
I wanted to ask what are some of the what

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.400
you might call the innovation to come in

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.220
the scanner as a product. Just trying to

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.360
get your impression. It's one of the more

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.180
labor intensive parts in this process.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.180
Yeah. Yeah. Are we expecting some new

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.320
product from Xerox to replace the scanner?

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.080
Not that I can think of. I mean, scanners,

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.980
I don't, you know, scanners are great. I'm

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.800
a great fan of scanners at this point. I

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.520
think the software that controls the

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.100
scanner is critical. And I mean, I will

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.500
definitely put in a plug for Pages. Pages

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.960
Pro 2.0 is what we've been using. It's a

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.460
wonderful application because it actually

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.880
lets you see what you're doing. And it

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.700
lets you go in and very, very easily you

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:37.860
get a row of thumbnails. You can reorder

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:41.200
them. You can rotate things so that you

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.040
can very, very easily, manually, but very

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.320
easily make sure that the online document

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.040
that you scan actually looks the way that

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.320
you want it to look. Now you can get, and

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.540
actually Pages also has wonderful sort of

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.740
automatic de-skewing, and you can watch

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.480
that happen too. It's very entertaining.

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.180
You sit there and you see your little

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.840
document get scanned and come up, and then

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.380
you see Pages align it, you know, fix its

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.380
alignment, and you go, that's great, you

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.120
know. So it's, I think it's a very, very

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.720
nice piece of software because it, you

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.200
know, as I say it makes everything that's

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.140
happening so visible. You can even, you

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.260
can both see the things that you need to

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.040
see in order to do the stuff manually that

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.920
you need to do and you can watch it doing

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.580
what it's doing automatically. And, you

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.060
know, you need some entertainment while

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.720
you're doing this. So it's helpful.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:40.680
Any others? I think we've exhausted

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.940
ourselves. Oh, oh. Everybody wants to go

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.780
after. That didn't sound right, did it?

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:52.560
I'm sorry. How do they maintain

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.420
the integrity of the binder system so that

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.660
you don't have everybody looking and

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.140
saying, oh, I need that, and then just

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.060
bring it to their desk? It's a problem. It

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.660
may or may not get back into that binder,

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:04.260
or it may not get back anywhere. It's a

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.120
problem. It's a problem. It's a problem.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.760
It's a problem. And that's actually a

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.200
problem, you know, again, this would help

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.200
address, because you can print out a copy

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.540
of the document and it's still there.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.840
there. All right. Thanks a lot.
