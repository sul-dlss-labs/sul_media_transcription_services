you

17:00.000 --> 17:00.200
you

17:44.360 --> 17:47.140
Tell Miss Hills the city now presents a

17:47.140 --> 17:49.620
complex traffic problem because most of

17:49.620 --> 17:52.420
its long street car lines must funnel into

17:52.420 --> 17:55.800
Market Street. This is true because there

17:55.800 --> 17:57.920
are no streets parallel to Market on the

17:57.920 --> 18:01.100
north side. As the city grows, the Market

18:01.100 --> 18:02.860
Street bottleneck draws tighter and

18:02.860 --> 18:05.720
tighter. Unless relief is found, this

18:05.720 --> 18:07.800
condition will seriously hamper the city's

18:07.800 --> 18:09.220
growth and progress.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.860
Market Street as it looks today from a

18:16.860 --> 18:21.180
balcony at Fifth Street. This, as you all

18:21.180 --> 18:23.880
know, is just an an average crowd trying

18:23.880 --> 18:27.780
to find a way to get home. From the

18:27.780 --> 18:29.540
balcony, the cable car turns on Powell

18:29.540 --> 18:32.440
Street. The cable car is a San Francisco

18:32.440 --> 18:34.720
invention, and our visitors never quit

18:34.720 --> 18:36.960
talking about it. We'll probably always

18:36.960 --> 18:39.020
have at least one cable car route here,

18:39.120 --> 18:40.820
just as a tourist attraction.

18:43.660 --> 18:47.600
We all ride to work, but how we have to

18:47.600 --> 18:52.380
work to ride. Here's a rush hour example.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.220
People stand in safety zones hoping the

18:55.220 --> 18:57.300
inspector will find room for them up

18:57.300 --> 19:01.640
front. But the space is all taken and

19:01.640 --> 19:03.760
disappointed patrons are turned away.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.620
Here's why. Too many cars are on the

19:10.620 --> 19:12.480
outside tracks owned by the municipal

19:12.480 --> 19:16.180
railway. The The inside tracks owned by

19:16.180 --> 19:18.400
Market Street Railway are not used to

19:18.400 --> 19:21.300
capacity. If these two systems are

19:21.300 --> 19:23.540
consolidated, the traffic burden will be

19:23.540 --> 19:26.060
equally distributed so that everybody can

19:26.060 --> 19:29.340
ride. One fare anywhere will do the trick.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.960
The unequal burden causes this,

19:37.160 --> 19:40.140
inconvenient, dangerous, and entirely

19:40.140 --> 19:44.140
unnecessary. When Madame Chiang Kai-shek

19:44.140 --> 19:46.160
was here, the traffic burden everywhere

19:46.160 --> 19:48.940
was too great under three systems, three

19:48.940 --> 19:52.720
managements, and three fares. We'll all

19:52.720 --> 19:55.400
agree this is a beautiful scene, but the

19:55.400 --> 19:57.280
discomfort and inconvenience are there

19:57.280 --> 20:00.100
just the same. We can correct this

20:00.100 --> 20:02.840
situation with one management, one fare

20:02.840 --> 20:05.940
anywhere, and free transfers everywhere.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.340
This serious bottleneck at Stockton and

20:10.340 --> 20:13.160
Market Streets can be broken. Instead of

20:13.160 --> 20:15.620
turning F cars back here, let's send them

20:15.620 --> 20:17.260
across Market Street to the Southern

20:17.260 --> 20:19.480
Pacific Depot, giving a new cross-town

20:19.480 --> 20:21.960
service to the Marina, North Beach, and

20:21.960 --> 20:24.980
Chinatown. Let's speed up this overloaded

20:24.980 --> 20:26.840
line. Let's give the Mission District

20:26.840 --> 20:29.600
direct access to north of Market sections.

20:33.660 --> 20:35.760
No mother likes this kind of a situation

20:35.760 --> 20:38.200
involving school children. We spend

20:38.200 --> 20:40.820
millions for schoolroom education. Let's

20:40.820 --> 20:42.840
spend something on traffic and safety.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.600
What are we doing for our war workers?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.760
These tired men coming off shift need

20:49.760 --> 20:52.140
speedy service home for a well-earned

20:52.140 --> 20:52.320
rest.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.060
Instead, they keep right on working,

21:00.160 --> 21:02.700
working as you do for a place on an

21:02.700 --> 21:05.320
overcrowded bus or streetcar and often

21:05.320 --> 21:07.280
payment of two fares before they reach

21:07.280 --> 21:10.280
home. These are not shoppers waiting for

21:10.280 --> 21:12.380
rationed meat, these are war plant workers

21:12.380 --> 21:14.720
waiting in line for a chance to ride home.

21:15.220 --> 21:18.260
They deserve that chance and you deserve

21:18.260 --> 21:22.520
that chance. Think of the thousands of

21:22.520 --> 21:24.360
hours we lose daily by transportation

21:24.360 --> 21:26.920
delays. Think of the ships and bombers

21:26.920 --> 21:28.660
that might have been built with this lost

21:28.660 --> 21:32.380
time. We can't afford it. We need those

21:32.380 --> 21:33.360
ships and bombers.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.280
Scores of streetcars now lie unused in car

21:40.280 --> 21:43.080
barns and shops. All these can be put to

21:43.080 --> 21:45.200
work on idle track space on Market and

21:45.200 --> 21:47.580
Mission streets. Let's use them.

21:50.980 --> 21:53.380
Under one management and with one fare

21:53.380 --> 21:56.620
anywhere, these idle cars can carry 20,000

21:56.620 --> 21:58.440
more people every day during the rush

21:58.440 --> 22:01.660
hours alone. It came like this and better.

22:02.140 --> 22:05.340
New, noiseless, speedy, streamlined cars.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.920
Fast, modern motor coaches taking the

22:07.920 --> 22:09.800
places of street cars wherever possible.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.880
Only in this way can San Francisco get rid

22:12.880 --> 22:15.080
of two of the four tracks on Market

22:15.080 --> 22:17.660
Street. You would like that, wouldn't you?

22:18.320 --> 22:21.300
These are hopes for the future. They are

22:21.300 --> 22:23.600
more than hopes, they are necessities. if

22:23.600 --> 22:26.160
the city we all love is not to strangle

22:26.160 --> 22:28.020
from its congestions and bottlenecks.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.280
Let's take the necessary step Tuesday,

22:31.660 --> 22:34.640
April 20th. Let's consolidate the existing

22:34.640 --> 22:36.700
systems without one cent of cost to

22:36.700 --> 22:39.320
taxpayers. The entire bill will be paid

22:39.320 --> 22:41.700
from revenues now swollen because there

22:41.700 --> 22:44.960
are so many newcomers here. This is the

22:44.960 --> 22:48.160
city that knows how, and here's how. Now

22:48.160 --> 22:51.920
vote yes on Tuesday for better service at

22:51.920 --> 22:56.000
no added cost. Let's forget our pet peeves

22:56.000 --> 22:58.160
and our prejudices. Let's think of the

22:58.160 --> 23:00.500
needs of our city and our country. Let's

23:00.500 --> 23:03.340
do something for San Francisco. Are you

23:03.340 --> 23:05.900
listening, San Francisco? This is the

23:05.900 --> 23:07.700
message of the Citizens Committee for

23:07.700 --> 23:10.040
Better Streetcar Service. We're voting yes

23:10.040 --> 23:11.540
for your future on Tuesday.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.900
 And all along the way

23:51.420 --> 23:57.740
We're building a dream for tomorrow We're

23:57.740 --> 24:03.860
building a dream for tomorrow Where trains

24:03.860 --> 24:06.960
that cross the hills and land Go through

24:06.960 --> 24:11.220
the town by night and day And sunshine

24:11.220 --> 24:15.260
touches every hand In parks where children

24:15.260 --> 24:22.740
play Over the hills and all along the way

24:22.740 --> 24:29.680
We're building a dream for tomorrow We're

24:29.680 --> 24:35.340
building a dream for tomorrow We're

24:35.340 --> 24:41.060
building a dream for tomorrow We're

24:41.060 --> 24:44.400
building a dream for tomorrow

24:48.320 --> 24:51.400
Along the way, in three counties, BART is

24:51.400 --> 24:53.840
building a high-speed rail rapid transit

24:53.840 --> 24:56.000
system planned for your convenience,

24:56.340 --> 24:58.720
designed for your comfort, and

24:58.720 --> 25:00.920
deliberately aimed at giving you a safer,

25:01.060 --> 25:03.360
faster, more economical ride than your

25:03.360 --> 25:06.140
automobile. Fully aware, as Lewis Mumford

25:06.140 --> 25:08.740
says, that a city exists not for the

25:08.740 --> 25:11.100
constant passage of motor cars, but for

25:11.100 --> 25:13.960
the care and culture of men. Cities will

25:13.960 --> 25:16.760
maintain their character, too. unscarred

25:16.760 --> 25:19.060
by heavy concrete swaths of freeway,

25:19.820 --> 25:21.720
freeways that carry the extravagance of

25:21.720 --> 25:24.700
one car, one passenger, mostly at a

25:24.700 --> 25:28.560
standstill. Instead, bark trains carrying

25:28.560 --> 25:30.960
thousands of comfortably seated passengers

25:30.960 --> 25:33.580
will glide quietly through the bay tube,

25:33.860 --> 25:37.260
under the ferry building, and into the

25:37.260 --> 25:38.120
Market Street subway.

25:41.820 --> 25:45.180
And when it's completed, you and the Bay

25:45.180 --> 25:47.860
Area will not only feel better, you'll

25:47.860 --> 25:51.020
both look better. In the Powell Street

25:51.020 --> 25:53.120
Station you'll look something like this.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.960
Along the way you may stop at a magazine

25:56.960 --> 25:59.740
stand, buy commute tickets from the

25:59.740 --> 26:02.520
automatic vending machine, enjoy the

26:02.520 --> 26:05.080
clean, spacious, architect-designed

26:05.080 --> 26:07.740
station, and then you'll board a train,

26:07.960 --> 26:11.540
carpet it, air-conditioned, and settle

26:11.540 --> 26:15.140
into an extra-wide foam rubber seat. Over

26:15.140 --> 26:19.960
the hills and all along the way we're

26:19.960 --> 26:25.600
building a dream for tomorrow. We're

26:25.600 --> 26:29.180
building a dream for tomorrow.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.840
Our commuters get one of the most exciting

27:01.840 --> 27:05.680
rides in the world. And boy, what a view!

27:16.600 --> 27:19.080
Ah, there's that spice and coffee smell

27:19.080 --> 27:19.360
again.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.040
One of the busiest intercity transit lines

27:54.040 --> 27:56.360
in the world safely delivers another

27:56.360 --> 27:59.140
trainload to the busiest terminal in

27:59.140 --> 27:59.460
America.

28:26.960 --> 28:27.160

The Golden Thames Society I know I live

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.380
there on the tower. Seagulls, pigeons, but

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:09.060
I like it. Yeah, we dig it the most. On

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.380
the tower I can see everything. Once in a

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.040
while I spy.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.660
I see the shoes. They think they're the

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:23.460
toughest, but not the bosses. But I don't

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:27.520
blame them. Nothing to do If I had

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.440
something like that on my corner I'd

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.640
shimmy shimmy Cocoa too The mole You can

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.740
always tell Flat feet Ace on every corner

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.800
Don't look too hard fellas They got guns

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.480
You got a thousand fellas The king In this

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.300
tough sheen It's the bosses Because it's

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:55.100
borrowed written from some honor at night

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.940
can always tell that's the lonely one

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.700
bet you some parts of mission could always

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:10.000
tell thousand every corner hair was a

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.840
crime they'd be right on death row with

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.260
chestnut look

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.480
out old man And look out, old man. Mike is

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.220
on the scene. Head first. Fight up,

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.220
fellas. Didn't cost me anything. Five

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.080
fingers and a quick getaway. Some store

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:30.520
suffers.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:48.100
you

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:18.100
you

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.100
you

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:18.100
you

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.100
you

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.760
San Francisco, within its 45 square miles,

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.640
is contained one of the most colorful and

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.900
and romantic cities in the world.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.340
Approaching from the south, the traveler

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.180
views with sudden excitement the city

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.840
thrusting its white towers into the blue

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.680
California sky.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.300
But it is from the east that the city

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.960
reveals its famous profile, framed by the

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.320
silver towers of the Bay Bridge.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.660
Credited with having stopped the onslaught

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.800
of the 1906 fire, Venice Avenue still

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.100
remains one of San Francisco's broadest

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:30.640
thoroughfares.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.660
California Palace of the Legion of Honor,

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.780
one of San Francisco's finest museums is

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.040
an exact replica of the Legion of Honor in

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:46.320
Paris.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.820
The once gay resort of the 90s is now a

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.420
modern restaurant fronting the Pacific

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.940
Ocean and overlooking Seals Rocks.

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:15.300
A ride on the newly installed Sky Tram

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.680
should be included in the tourist

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.260
itinerary.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.180
Just below the Cliff House is a year-round

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.080
amusement park. Park.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.020


01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.800
Leaving the recreational areas that border

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.640
the ocean, we turn eastward towards the

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.260
heart of the city.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:39.680
city. In the center of the city rise San

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.400
Francisco's famous Twin Peaks.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.100
reached by a spiraling road the summit

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.980
commands a spectacular view of the

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:53.720
encircling city

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.480
Market Street, the main arterial through

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.060
the downtown area, stretches like a broad

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.800
ribbon from Twin Peaks to the Ferry

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.100
Building.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.100
The busy intersection of Powell and Market

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.580
Streets in downtown San Francisco is

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.420
located one of the terminals of the Powell

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.740
Street cable car line. To reverse their

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.360
direction, the cable cars are pushed onto

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.540
the unique turntable and swung around

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.080
manually by the motor man and the

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.180
conductor, much to the delight of the

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.160
riders and spectators.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.520
There is no end to the interesting places

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.020
one may visit in San Francisco, the ferry

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.080
the library building, the churches and

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:33.520
colleges.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.780
Or the tourist may prefer a leisurely

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.780
drive along the many scenic boulevards.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.800
For the true adventurer, there is that

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.680
final thrill, a ride down the world's most

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.340
crooked streets. Eight hairpin turns in a

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:02.000
single block.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.860
San Francisco, the cosmopolitan city,

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:46.620
queen of the Pacific, the city by the

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.360
Golden Gate,

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.640
Truly the city of many wonders.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:17.560
you

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:47.560
you

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.260
Thank you.
