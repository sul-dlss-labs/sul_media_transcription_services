Tibet or China, Would this be a problem

01:57.460 --> 01:58.020

and appreciate very much your

02:14.740 --> 02:16.000
participation in the project.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.520
How old are you?

02:27.200 --> 02:27.880
71.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.540
And where are you from in Tibet?

02:36.360 --> 02:43.760
So the place

02:43.760 --> 02:48.380
where I lived was called La Gong. And in

02:48.380 --> 02:50.020
which province was La Gong?

03:04.660 --> 03:10.660
I came to Lhasa in 1961-62 when the

03:10.660 --> 03:12.760
Chinese created a lot of problems.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.080
Where were you born? In which province?

03:36.980 --> 03:40.900
So when you came to Lhasa, you were about

03:40.900 --> 03:41.540
how old?

03:57.960 --> 04:02.120
So I must have been about 36 years old and

04:02.120 --> 04:04.840
when I came to Lhasa I had three children

04:04.840 --> 04:07.820
with me and then three were born in Lhasa.

04:07.820 --> 04:08.560
Okay.

04:10.820 --> 04:15.660
So that's been so long ago. In your

04:15.660 --> 04:20.440
village, what did your father do?피유argent

04:20.440 --> 04:24.160
How much money could we use to pay your

04:24.160 --> 04:26.700
wife? How much is here? Here

04:26.700 --> 04:30.360
in我们的能力和能力可在这个地方可以付你,

04:30.360 --> 04:32.840
here in this steel house we don't have

04:32.840 --> 04:35.900
enough to cover, so this is all we can do

04:35.900 --> 04:38.560
in about an acre of land.

04:46.620 --> 04:51.320
So in those days my father was a farmer

04:51.320 --> 04:54.480
working in the commune and then we would

04:54.480 --> 04:59.100
dig up medicinal plants called popi from

04:59.100 --> 05:04.560
the ground. So you were in a commune, a

05:04.560 --> 05:06.720
Tibetan commune, or was this a Chinese

05:06.720 --> 05:08.380
commune? What is the meaning of the word

05:08.380 --> 05:11.040
Nyaamle? The word Nyaamle is the meaning

05:11.040 --> 05:15.240
of the father and the mother. The father

05:15.240 --> 05:19.060
is the mother and the mother is the

05:19.060 --> 05:31.180
mother. The father is the mother.

05:46.140 --> 05:52.580
So it was a Tibetan commune run by Chinese

05:52.580 --> 05:56.040
and the farmers harvested, when the

05:56.040 --> 05:58.800
farmers harvested grains and wheat and

05:58.800 --> 06:01.780
barley we would have to give them to the

06:01.780 --> 06:04.520
Chinese so being unable to endure the

06:04.520 --> 06:06.780
suffering my husband and I and children

06:06.780 --> 06:09.860
fled or went to went to Lhasa. Went to

06:09.860 --> 06:14.960
Lhasa, right. So what memories do you have

06:14.960 --> 06:17.120
of your childhood when you were a little

06:17.120 --> 06:17.440
girl?

06:26.340 --> 06:27.520
I'm like, can I change you in a bit,

06:27.580 --> 06:27.760
Kabla?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.540
What should I say about when I was little?

06:42.160 --> 06:47.880
I have no

06:47.880 --> 06:53.720
memories of my younger days. Okay. What

06:53.720 --> 06:54.500
did your mother do?

07:00.240 --> 07:01.640
숏

07:38.580 --> 07:44.480
So in the commune she had the task of

07:44.480 --> 07:48.380
milking and then also carrying hay on the

07:48.380 --> 07:51.500
back to be spread under the horses and

07:51.500 --> 07:54.960
mules and then after we escaped I had no

07:54.960 --> 07:59.120
idea about them but I think they have all

07:59.120 --> 08:03.300
passed away now. So did you help your

08:03.300 --> 08:05.380
mother or your father with their work on

08:05.380 --> 08:05.980
the commune?

08:25.480 --> 08:26.080
No,

08:30.080 --> 08:33.000
because I had little children then, and so

08:33.000 --> 08:35.180
instead of helping them, I needed their

08:35.180 --> 08:35.640
help.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.740
How old were you when you had your first

08:40.740 --> 08:41.140
child?

09:03.800 --> 09:08.800
So we don't normally calculate our years

09:08.800 --> 09:11.480
and ages. So it was like, you know,

09:11.520 --> 09:14.100
animals giving birth. Likewise, we too

09:14.100 --> 09:18.440
gave birth to our children. Do your

09:18.440 --> 09:19.500
children live with you now?

09:26.940 --> 09:31.280
No, not together. I have three children,

09:31.400 --> 09:35.100
and I had my children in the hospital. Can

09:35.100 --> 09:37.620
you tell us about your experiences giving

09:37.620 --> 09:41.140
birth to children? So, Marwa, you are a

09:41.140 --> 09:43.760
very good teacher. You have taught us a

09:43.760 --> 09:47.180
lot of things. So, what do you think about

09:47.180 --> 09:50.840
teaching us how to be a good teacher? I

09:50.840 --> 09:53.820
don't know how to teach. I have been

09:53.820 --> 09:56.760
teaching since I was a child. I have been

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
teaching since I was a child. I don't know

09:58.760 --> 10:02.720
how to teach. I don't know how to teach. I

10:02.720 --> 10:04.660
don't know how to teach. I don't know how

10:04.660 --> 10:05.000
to teach.

10:14.620 --> 10:20.880
So I didn't give

10:20.880 --> 10:26.060
birth

10:26.060 --> 10:29.460
in hospitals and it was my husband that

10:29.460 --> 10:34.940
helped me during the childbirth. and it

10:34.940 --> 10:38.320
is only my daughter that was born in

10:38.320 --> 10:40.740
hospital and I couldn't give birth to her

10:40.740 --> 10:43.220
and all my other children including the

10:43.220 --> 10:47.660
twins were not born in hospital. How did

10:47.660 --> 10:48.740
your husband help you?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.940
I was a little girl, and I was a little

11:02.940 --> 11:07.000
girl. I was a little girl, and I was a

11:07.000 --> 11:10.140
little girl. I was a little girl, and I

11:10.140 --> 11:11.280
was a little girl. I was a little girl,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.540
and I was a little girl. I was a little

11:13.540 --> 11:17.380
girl, and I was a little girl. I was a

11:17.380 --> 11:20.680
little girl, and I was a little girl. I

11:20.680 --> 11:21.500
was a little girl, and I was a little

11:21.500 --> 11:21.780
girl.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.720
So when the first of the twins was born, I

11:44.720 --> 11:48.480
was on my knees and my husband, he took

11:48.480 --> 11:50.780
the child wrapped it in cloth and laid it

11:50.780 --> 11:54.220
on the bed and then I went out to answer

11:54.220 --> 11:57.140
nature's call and then I could feel that

11:57.140 --> 12:00.900
there was another child in me and so I

12:00.900 --> 12:03.800
told my husband that there is one more

12:03.800 --> 12:07.040
child and he said it can't be but then I

12:07.040 --> 12:09.420
said there is one more and then the other

12:09.420 --> 12:12.720
one was born and while breastfeeding I had

12:12.720 --> 12:15.440
to feed one child here and one child here

12:15.440 --> 12:17.900
and it was same when I was feeding them

12:17.900 --> 12:21.540
food later. At the same time, feeding them

12:21.540 --> 12:23.740
one here, one here? At the same time.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.020
Thujujjipa le chikla omadetje, chikla

12:26.020 --> 12:29.200
omadetje, roa? Nyaka tew. Nyaka ngode.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.620
Ngode nyaka sumte omadetje. Yes, because

12:32.620 --> 12:35.360
both cried at the same time. Cried, cried.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.760
And were all your children healthy when

12:38.760 --> 12:41.200
they were born? Amla, puku ketiw ka ne

12:41.200 --> 12:44.260
puku tsangma tangpo duwe? A instead of습니까

12:44.260 --> 13:07.180
, the

13:15.660 --> 13:20.120
So the second of the twins was born leg

13:20.120 --> 13:23.300
first, and I thought it was a headless

13:23.300 --> 13:27.120
child. And then my husband pulled it out,

13:27.200 --> 13:30.220
and there was no crying, so I thought it

13:30.220 --> 13:32.620
wasn't alive. And when I touched the leg,

13:32.660 --> 13:35.100
it was warm, and then my husband cleaned

13:35.100 --> 13:39.840
it up. How did you feel? Can you remember

13:39.840 --> 13:40.680
your emotions?

14:37.180 --> 14:39.340
twins, you know, if one child got sick

14:39.340 --> 14:41.680
around 12 o'clock, the other would become

14:41.680 --> 14:45.520
sick at 3 p.m. So both had to be carried

14:45.520 --> 14:48.340
to the hospital in Pasa and it was very

14:48.340 --> 14:51.120
difficult. And then later my husband found

14:51.120 --> 14:55.020
work at a construction site and I could

14:55.020 --> 14:57.960
also find work but I couldn't do much as I

14:57.960 --> 15:01.600
was sick most of the time. So when you

15:01.600 --> 15:03.800
were sick, who took care of your children?

15:03.800 --> 15:03.880
one.

15:09.720 --> 15:23.280
There wasn't

15:23.280 --> 15:26.020
anyone else to take care of them. I had to

15:26.020 --> 15:27.660
and then when my husband been returned

15:27.660 --> 15:29.860
from work then we took care of them

15:29.860 --> 15:34.160
together so when you lived in Lhasa did

15:34.160 --> 15:38.520
you have family who also lived in Lhasa or

15:38.520 --> 15:39.380
lived near you

15:42.280 --> 15:45.280
I'm lucky that not me down pinga shambhala

15:45.280 --> 15:48.080
in the hustle a your a your mother no no

15:48.080 --> 15:52.960
both of us didn't have any relatives so

15:52.960 --> 15:58.600
you said that you went to Lhasa and you

15:58.600 --> 16:02.020
had three children what what made your

16:02.020 --> 16:03.240
family go to Lhasa?

16:44.580 --> 16:49.140
So we had to leave our hometown because we

16:49.140 --> 16:51.680
couldn't survive there. there, there was

16:51.680 --> 16:54.660
lack of food because if you couldn't work

16:54.660 --> 16:57.740
hard, there was no grains for you, and

16:57.740 --> 17:00.960
then since we had many children, both of

17:00.960 --> 17:04.200
us couldn't survive there and that's why

17:04.200 --> 17:06.680
my husband suggested that we go to Lhasa.

17:08.060 --> 17:12.460
Why wasn't there enough food? And Magali,

17:12.580 --> 17:16.960
how do you do the work? We do it by hand.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.140
We do it by hand. We do it by hand. We do

17:25.140 --> 17:27.620
it by hand. We do it by hand.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.860
So in the commune system, you know, if you

17:39.860 --> 17:44.220
could work, the officials gave you marks,

17:44.500 --> 17:46.940
and if you didn't, you know, there was no

17:46.940 --> 17:48.940
marks, which meant that you got no grains.

17:50.680 --> 17:56.360
But you worked, didn't you? Did you eat

17:56.360 --> 17:56.420
anything?

18:01.880 --> 18:02.920
We did,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.720
but there was nothing to eat, so we left.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.640
Was it because you had so many children

18:12.640 --> 18:14.560
that what you were allowed, what you were

18:14.560 --> 18:17.120
allocated wasn't enough? That the Master

18:17.120 --> 18:19.500
of the Pugongине Gövde. Has main Heckling

18:19.500 --> 18:20.380
had the same architecture available with

18:20.380 --> 18:23.020
Rei? Yes, it was possible there were

18:23.020 --> 18:26.200
liveumen inside. Listen in the New York.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.060
At北심, he visited the same place, ...

18:31.060 --> 18:35.500
practiced Hitt

18:35.500 --> 18:41.000
GI

18:47.660 --> 18:50.320
Yeah, the allocation wasn't sufficient.

18:50.780 --> 18:53.680
Right. And then when we were in Hassa, a

18:53.680 --> 18:56.200
friend of my husband suggested that, you

18:56.200 --> 19:00.240
know, since we had many children, that if

19:00.240 --> 19:02.700
we went to Nepal, it would be a better

19:02.700 --> 19:05.040
life for the children. So that's why we

19:05.040 --> 19:10.920
came to Nepal. Right. Right. We'll come

19:10.920 --> 19:13.060
back to Nepal in a minute, but I was

19:13.060 --> 19:16.680
wondering, in what ways was life in Lhasa

19:16.680 --> 19:20.120
different from life in the village?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.380
The people of the village, they are very

19:40.380 --> 19:44.660
good at it. They are very good at it. They

19:44.660 --> 19:47.140
are very good at it. They are very good at

19:47.140 --> 19:51.140
it. They are very good at it. They are

19:51.140 --> 19:54.340
very good at it. They are very good at it.

19:55.180 --> 19:58.560
They are very good at it. They are very

19:58.560 --> 20:01.080
good at it. They are very good at it. They

20:01.080 --> 20:02.620
are very good at it. They are very good at

20:02.620 --> 20:05.200
it. They are very good at it.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.760
So it was

20:29.760 --> 20:33.100
better in Lhasa because my husband was

20:33.100 --> 20:36.300
engaged in the construction. work and then

20:36.300 --> 20:38.820
friends and other people they used to give

20:38.820 --> 20:42.760
us little bags of Sambal. Were there other

20:42.760 --> 20:44.400
ways in which your life in Lhasa was

20:44.400 --> 20:46.200
different from the village? You had more

20:46.200 --> 20:49.240
food but were there other ways in which

20:49.240 --> 20:50.260
your life was different?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.680
I don't know, I can't say.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.220
So I have only so much to say. Right. So

21:13.220 --> 21:17.800
your family decided to come to Nepal. Can

21:17.800 --> 21:20.900
you tell us the story of coming to Nepal?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.120
The women used to marry them like a

21:49.120 --> 21:49.120
princess.

21:52.220 --> 21:56.480
Tengri? Yes, Cassandra would marry

21:56.480 --> 22:00.200
Cassandra, Mr. Park and Mrs. MEntry. Mr. M

22:00.200 --> 22:04.140
werner and Mrs. Kim . If Mr. M would buy a

22:04.140 --> 22:09.820
present, Mrs. Park would buy a toy.

22:09.820 --> 22:14.160
alienating people who die as citizens

22:14.160 --> 22:16.700
these problems with an international

22:18.900 --> 22:20.300
officially

23:09.820 --> 23:12.800
There were times when we were on foot, and

23:12.800 --> 23:15.680
at times for an hour or two, we would ply

23:15.680 --> 23:17.720
by vehicles, but since we didn't have

23:17.720 --> 23:20.900
money to pay, we couldn't get vehicles

23:20.900 --> 23:24.240
right through. And it was from the border

23:24.240 --> 23:27.620
area of Tingri and Tamil that we came

23:27.620 --> 23:31.760
towards Nepal. And we were with quite a

23:31.760 --> 23:34.260
number of little children, and my husband

23:34.260 --> 23:37.780
was carrying one of the twins over his

23:37.780 --> 23:40.620
neck, and the oldest son was carrying one

23:40.620 --> 23:44.900
of the other twins and the pathway was

23:44.900 --> 23:47.500
filled with snow and there were some

23:47.500 --> 23:49.920
Chinese people along the way that stopped

23:49.920 --> 23:52.560
us but since we were with little children

23:52.560 --> 23:55.500
they allowed us to go and in fact there

23:55.500 --> 23:58.060
were two girls that commented that the

23:58.060 --> 24:01.400
twins were very beautiful and then thanks

24:01.400 --> 24:04.040
to the grace of His Holiness we were able

24:04.040 --> 24:08.460
to escape safely. How long did it take you

24:08.460 --> 24:12.180
to come from Lhasa to Nepal? We came from

24:12.180 --> 24:14.760
Lhasa to Paya Bado, and then we went to

24:14.760 --> 24:19.660
Khorso. We came from Khorso to Khorso. We

24:19.660 --> 24:24.120
came from Khorso

24:24.120 --> 24:27.940
to Khorso.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.120
So it might have taken about half a month,

24:34.300 --> 24:36.760
because at times we were walking and at

24:36.760 --> 24:39.300
times we could get lift in some vehicles.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.460
So what did you take with you when you

24:42.460 --> 24:43.500
left Tibet?

24:49.820 --> 25:13.480
Mother Interior Deepa,

25:13.480 --> 25:13.480
can you judgge us about the ABS Act.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.540
So we had brought nothing except our

25:23.540 --> 25:27.460
blankets and a little bit of samba. And

25:27.460 --> 25:30.580
when we reached Nepal, my husband had

25:30.580 --> 25:33.300
friends to whom we sent message, and they

25:33.300 --> 25:36.120
came to fetch us at the reception

25:36.120 --> 25:40.680
committee office. And did you have enough

25:40.680 --> 25:43.840
food, enough sampa for your whole family

25:43.840 --> 25:45.620
to go for these two weeks?

26:10.660 --> 26:16.340
history of the plant Thank my

27:05.020 --> 27:05.020
I was very young, I was very young, I was

27:05.020 --> 27:06.140
very young, I was very young, I was very

27:06.140 --> 27:06.600
young, I was very

27:24.900 --> 27:29.420
So we had a little bit of sampa, and I

27:29.420 --> 27:31.840
used to feed the children in spoonfuls,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.760
which they used to gulp. and then we were

27:34.760 --> 27:38.260
able to cross over a mountain and there

27:38.260 --> 27:41.260
was a river and nearby we found some

27:41.260 --> 27:43.380
Nepalese police and we were really very

27:43.380 --> 27:47.880
scared and I told my husband, will they

27:47.880 --> 27:50.900
not kill us now? And then we met some

27:50.900 --> 27:53.580
merchants who said that now you need have

27:53.580 --> 27:56.400
no fear because you are in Nepalese

27:56.400 --> 27:59.580
territory and you will no longer fall into

27:59.580 --> 28:01.900
Chinese hands. But still they were very

28:01.900 --> 28:07.220
scared. And then we saw some Nepali road

28:07.220 --> 28:10.440
crew and they were living in little tents

28:10.440 --> 28:14.740
and so we entered one of the tents and

28:14.740 --> 28:17.700
they gave us hot water and I made little

28:17.700 --> 28:21.980
balls of dough with the Sampar and hot

28:21.980 --> 28:25.080
water and fed my children. And then we

28:25.080 --> 28:27.840
went to Dharamsala and we were very happy

28:27.840 --> 28:35.500
to see His So you arrived in Nepal and

28:35.500 --> 28:38.760
then how did you get to Dharamsala?

28:48.240 --> 28:53.080
The reception committee there dropped us

28:53.080 --> 28:57.740
to Dharamsala. I want to go back to make

28:57.740 --> 29:00.460
sure I've understood something. So your

29:00.460 --> 29:03.940
decision to leave Nepal, I mean to leave

29:03.940 --> 29:08.280
Tibet, was because of hunger? What was the

29:08.280 --> 29:10.400
reason why you left Tibet? Tibet.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.060
Now meditating isau mechawawa le me

30:08.160 --> 30:11.920
And very cupid and Hassa was better and

30:11.920 --> 30:15.120
then in the hometown but our children were

30:15.120 --> 30:18.000
not getting any education in Hassa so and

30:18.000 --> 30:20.300
we were told that if we went to Nepal we

30:20.300 --> 30:22.640
would be able to admit our children into

30:22.640 --> 30:25.320
school so for the sake of our children we

30:25.320 --> 30:33.140
left Tibet. So you lived in Tibet when the

30:33.140 --> 30:36.560
Chinese were there. How was life like like

30:36.560 --> 30:38.060
for you under the Chinese?

31:03.060 --> 31:07.860
So I do not have much knowledge. That's

31:07.860 --> 31:11.840
between in the offices that happens and my

31:11.840 --> 31:16.120
job was just doing my work. And your work

31:16.120 --> 31:18.740
was what? What was your work? In Amalagi,

31:18.760 --> 31:23.160
I was teaching. I was teaching the

31:23.160 --> 31:25.000
students and the teachers.

31:41.100 --> 31:46.460
So our responsibility was harvesting the

31:46.460 --> 31:51.520
barley and then de-husking them in a large

31:51.520 --> 31:55.300
open ground during the commune, but I have

31:55.300 --> 31:58.260
forgotten much of it. What about in Lhasa?

31:58.440 --> 32:01.460
What was your work in Lhasa? In Lhasa, we

32:01.460 --> 32:04.540
used to go to the forest to buy food. We

32:04.540 --> 32:11.080
used to go to the forest to buy food. We

32:11.080 --> 32:15.600
used to go to the forest to buy

32:15.600 --> 32:20.200
food. I don't know how to do it. I don't

32:20.200 --> 32:21.020
know how to do it. I don't know how to do

32:21.020 --> 32:22.800
it. I don't know how to do it.

32:26.020 --> 32:28.020
It's like what I told you earlier,

32:28.260 --> 32:31.020
constructing houses, digging the ground,

32:31.180 --> 32:33.740
laying the bricks, and building as it

32:33.740 --> 32:37.100
happens here. You did that. Amla Adinala,

32:37.200 --> 32:40.120
Lera Cheyina, Kambas Yuga Dwaya Adinala. I

32:40.120 --> 32:45.640
did it like this. Like this. No, I

32:45.640 --> 32:47.720
couldn't go to work because I was sick.

32:48.400 --> 32:54.400
Right. Okay. Did you have any interactions

32:54.400 --> 32:55.780
with Chinese people?

32:58.780 --> 33:01.680
No. So did life change for you when the

33:01.680 --> 33:09.440
Chinese came to you? No. Did life

33:09.440 --> 33:14.600
change for you when the Chinese came to

33:14.600 --> 33:14.960
Tibet?

33:41.700 --> 33:49.000
Yes, in 1961-62, by then the Chinese had

33:49.000 --> 33:51.900
already launched the liberation. And at

33:51.900 --> 33:54.180
that time, when my husband and I escaped,

33:55.200 --> 33:59.580
there wasn't many people escaping then,

33:59.760 --> 34:02.520
but later on, more and more people started

34:02.520 --> 34:06.540
coming. And what happened then?

34:37.280 --> 34:40.080
Once we were at the reception center here

34:40.080 --> 34:42.900
and then we were sent to see His Holiness

34:42.900 --> 34:45.360
the Dalai Lama in the Ramsala and then the

34:45.360 --> 34:47.640
children were put in school and then my

34:47.640 --> 34:50.420
husband and I, we were sent to a factory

34:50.420 --> 34:53.740
in Dalahousey in Himachal Pradesh and then

34:53.740 --> 34:56.460
there was no problem at all. Was your

34:56.460 --> 34:59.000
husband affected at all by the Chinese

34:59.000 --> 34:59.440
occupation?

35:29.440 --> 35:38.280
That's why I'm saying that he

35:38.280 --> 35:40.740
was a construction worker. He was a

35:40.740 --> 35:44.400
construction worker in Pasta. He was

35:44.400 --> 35:49.220
laying the iron rods for the construction.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.860
After coming into India, he worked as an

35:53.860 --> 35:59.740
embosser of handmade carpets. Right at the

35:59.740 --> 36:02.840
beginning you mentioned that most of your

36:02.840 --> 36:05.900
children except for your last child were

36:05.900 --> 36:09.060
born at home. But one child was born in

36:09.060 --> 36:12.200
the hospital. Why was that child born in

36:12.200 --> 36:15.040
the hospital? What caused you to go to the

36:15.040 --> 36:15.960
hospital for that birth?

36:39.520 --> 36:43.960
So I was having labor pains but could not

36:43.960 --> 36:46.420
give birth. So that's why I went to the

36:46.420 --> 36:50.020
hospital. And your baby was safe. And the

36:50.020 --> 36:52.020
boy, how was he? Was he okay? He was okay.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.340
He was okay. He was okay. He was fine.

36:58.580 --> 37:06.940
Amen. He was fine. He was fine. He was

37:06.940 --> 37:09.700
fine. I was very young, I was very young,

37:09.760 --> 37:11.760
I was very young, I was very young, I was

37:11.760 --> 37:15.820
very young, I was very young, I was very

37:15.820 --> 37:19.800
young, I was very young, I was very young,

37:20.500 --> 37:24.560
I was very young, I was very young, I was

37:24.560 --> 37:26.520
very young, I was very young, I was very

37:26.520 --> 37:27.520
young, I was very young, I was very young,

37:27.520 --> 37:29.320
I was very young, I was very young, I was

37:29.320 --> 37:30.720
very young, I was very young, I was very

37:30.720 --> 37:32.120
young, I was very young, I was very young,

37:32.300 --> 37:33.840
I was very young, I was very young, I was

37:33.840 --> 37:33.840
very young, I was very young, I was very

37:33.840 --> 37:33.840
young, I was very young, I was very young,

37:33.840 --> 37:33.840
I was very young, I was very young, I was

37:33.840 --> 37:33.840
very young, I was very young, I was very

37:33.840 --> 37:33.840
young, I was very young, I was very young,

37:33.840 --> 37:33.840
I was very young, I was very young, I was

37:33.840 --> 37:35.220
very young, I was very young, I was very

37:35.220 --> 37:36.680
young, I was very young, I was very young,

37:36.680 --> 37:38.440
I was very last child was born in hospital

37:38.440 --> 37:42.460
after five or six days. Actually the labor

37:42.460 --> 37:45.420
pains had started and the child wasn't

37:45.420 --> 37:48.440
born so the nurse told me that I would

37:48.440 --> 37:50.420
have to stay in hospital for a few days

37:50.420 --> 37:52.980
because it was a big child but I didn't

37:52.980 --> 37:55.600
want to stay and wanted to go back home

37:55.600 --> 37:59.920
and my husband said that you know wouldn't

37:59.920 --> 38:02.120
take me home saying that you know If we

38:02.120 --> 38:04.760
went back home, the child and I would die.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.240
Is there anything else that you would like

38:09.240 --> 38:11.280
to share with us about your life in Tibet?

38:17.840 --> 38:19.140
That's about it.

38:22.480 --> 38:27.580
Thank you. If this interview were shown in

38:27.580 --> 38:30.340
Tibet or China, would it be a problem for

38:30.340 --> 38:30.540
you?

38:42.720 --> 38:48.680
I don't know

38:48.680 --> 38:51.400
whether there will be any problems or no

38:51.400 --> 38:54.220
problems. Is it okay if we use your real

38:54.220 --> 38:58.460
name? I think that's the way it is. I

38:58.460 --> 39:00.980
think that's the way it is. I think that's

39:00.980 --> 39:04.160
the way it is. Yes, it is. If I had a lot

39:04.160 --> 39:07.300
of money, I would have a lot of money.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.600
Yes, but then if the Chinese come and

39:11.600 --> 39:15.040
investigate, they may take me away. Thank

39:15.040 --> 39:17.240
you very much for sharing your story with

39:17.240 --> 39:17.500
us.
