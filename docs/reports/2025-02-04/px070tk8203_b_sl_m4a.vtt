WEBVTT

00:05.980 --> 00:08.340
Yeah, so you're having, you have this

00:08.340 --> 00:10.900
movement and you can hear very well when

00:10.900 --> 00:13.460
you open and it's just your, you don't

00:13.460 --> 00:15.780
think about your step, they're just tired

00:15.780 --> 00:18.460
the legs, so they're you're deep and you

00:18.460 --> 00:21.120
walk with your chest. So for me it's like

00:21.120 --> 00:25.280
you are walking like this, walking here.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.080
here, then we have this movement, this

00:29.080 --> 00:35.620
one, over,

00:35.840 --> 00:39.300
hold circle to here, and then through the

00:39.300 --> 00:44.060
back, through the back, here, and then

00:44.060 --> 00:51.920
quick up, and again down, quick up, and

00:51.920 --> 00:54.720
down, Oh yeah, and then you have your

00:54.720 --> 00:56.760
accent, so you do again this one.

01:03.740 --> 01:06.980
Okay. Yeah, and then it tells you to stop

01:06.980 --> 01:11.580
anyway. Marking maybe from this part.

01:15.620 --> 01:20.380
So from the music, we like just like let's

01:20.380 --> 01:23.060
learn the music. I think, Matthias, when

01:23.060 --> 01:23.580
we're...

02:18.420 --> 02:21.640
Okay, okay. This is with the steps also,

02:21.820 --> 02:25.440
no? This one is still with the, like with

02:25.440 --> 02:29.260
the raw, still like with the raw. And

02:29.260 --> 02:32.000
step, step, so it's a kind of step, step,

02:32.060 --> 02:34.440
yes, it's only in small, but the rhythm,

02:34.540 --> 02:35.240
but the feet stay.

02:40.940 --> 02:47.520
Then from here, you

02:47.520 --> 02:51.040
go in this direction, you have a small

02:51.040 --> 02:59.500
attitude, leg, leg, arm, arm, this, again

02:59.500 --> 03:02.700
this movement, Till you have an attitude,

03:02.980 --> 03:08.720
then you have this what the men do before,

03:09.000 --> 03:16.240
this, this, cut, passe, passe soutenu,

03:16.360 --> 03:23.700
till here, big raw to the floor, on the

03:23.700 --> 03:25.120
knee, yeah, all the way to the, yes, like

03:25.120 --> 03:30.120
that turn around very low and then very

03:30.120 --> 03:37.100
very front and one yes big fall and then

03:37.100 --> 03:41.180
you push back and you go again into this

03:41.180 --> 03:49.260
movement one. This, this, this, arm, arm.

03:50.340 --> 03:53.300
Here we won't have time really. And then

03:53.300 --> 04:00.440
comes turn, turn, Hop, step, step. Yes,

04:00.500 --> 04:03.020
yeah. So, yeah.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.980
Then you have to go a little bit backwards

04:11.980 --> 04:14.020
again to the foot, otherwise you are

04:14.020 --> 04:17.980
traveling too far. So you go always like

04:17.980 --> 04:22.460
it stays on the spot, yes. But not, not,

04:22.460 --> 04:24.520
not, the steps are not too big. the step

04:24.520 --> 04:33.620
is not too big yeah yeah

04:33.620 --> 04:36.220
okay okay yes

04:42.280 --> 04:42.820
whatever

04:47.460 --> 04:50.120
from the attitude you know where we ended

04:56.460 --> 04:57.100
Yeah.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

05:05.020 --> 05:05.660
Also...

05:52.600 --> 05:54.000


06:06.940 --> 06:09.920
but we're coming soon to the end anyway

06:13.440 --> 06:16.780
marking again just but mark really you

06:16.780 --> 06:19.980
know it's it's hard fernando

06:24.380 --> 06:27.760
Yeah, come a bit more forward. No, my

06:27.760 --> 06:28.640
reserve is still a bit.

07:23.340 --> 07:23.700


07:35.840 --> 07:39.140
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now with this new

07:39.140 --> 07:44.580
music, you're having a parallel jump in

07:44.580 --> 07:47.020
contraction. You're having the arms like

07:47.020 --> 07:50.140
this in the jump. It's fist, actually

07:50.140 --> 07:50.860
fist, no?

07:57.960 --> 08:02.780
Yeah, this, then it's like very fast. It's

08:02.780 --> 08:08.040
the turn, this, you turn, but this goes

08:08.040 --> 08:10.660
into, you turn like this, but this goes

08:10.660 --> 08:11.940
into this movement.

08:15.580 --> 08:20.980
You jump like this, you jump here. then

08:20.980 --> 08:24.860
you start the turn like this and from here

08:24.860 --> 08:28.380
you already touch it again you meet and

08:28.380 --> 08:33.520
you go into this movement this into the

08:33.520 --> 08:35.900
move and then you will be interrupted and

08:35.900 --> 08:39.780
you do another one i'm sorry i'm sorry i

08:39.780 --> 08:42.780
mixed it up with the second time yes oh

08:42.780 --> 08:48.940
sorry I mix it up with the second time. So

08:48.940 --> 08:56.200
again, so you have this, you turn into

08:56.200 --> 09:04.320
this and it comes here, down and up. go

09:04.320 --> 09:11.700
into this and open and down and very quick

09:11.700 --> 09:16.600
up you're done either way up and a little

09:16.600 --> 09:19.840
bit of this woman and then it's just like

09:19.840 --> 09:22.500
you just have no energy just on the knees

09:22.500 --> 09:25.920
they collapse and then And then just ploof

09:25.920 --> 09:31.080
and back.

09:31.940 --> 09:37.080
And actually, well anyway, that routine is

09:37.080 --> 09:37.800
before actually.

09:41.020 --> 09:47.540
And then goes the whole diagonal. Jump,

09:47.880 --> 09:51.080
accent, accent.

09:54.580 --> 09:58.260
Then actually you're over there, very far.

09:58.480 --> 10:03.660
I speak here anyway. So you are, then

10:03.660 --> 10:06.680
comes again this one with this movement

10:06.680 --> 10:11.140
but without the turn. You do jump again.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.000
It goes into this movement and the music

10:15.000 --> 10:17.100
will interrupt you. So we have to kind of

10:17.100 --> 10:20.660
do another one. So and to the hands, to

10:20.660 --> 10:21.140
the face.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.180
Yes, and then it's this music where it

10:30.180 --> 10:32.020
happened to you. You have to continue.

10:32.200 --> 10:37.020
Yes, it's like, yes. You go kind of

10:37.020 --> 10:40.440
middle. Yeah.

10:46.100 --> 10:46.460
up

10:55.200 --> 10:58.600
and then the last one is a mixture out of

10:58.600 --> 11:02.940
this movement and out of this moment the

11:02.940 --> 11:05.960
very quick ones on the end so where do we

11:05.960 --> 11:07.660
start from

11:12.480 --> 11:15.040
Music like? It's easier with music, the

11:15.040 --> 11:20.720
music tells you. And no more really. .

11:21.920 --> 11:24.520
Yeah, stop, yes. Okay, do from here. Here,

11:24.540 --> 11:25.640
altitude.

11:44.040 --> 11:44.740
Up.

12:02.140 --> 12:05.000
Yes, it's many times more, more than that,

12:05.100 --> 12:06.580
but anyway, you don't have to go on this

12:06.580 --> 12:09.820
actually. Is this the other leg?

12:15.480 --> 12:20.060
Yes, and turn, turn, up, open, open, down,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.740
up. That's very quickly, up, up. and then

12:23.740 --> 12:29.320
comes right away this one. This one and

12:29.320 --> 12:36.520
knee, fall and And...

12:47.100 --> 12:49.440
Just try it down, this time you're here,

12:49.600 --> 12:51.360
and then you have either way, yes.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.100
One time, then a jump again.

13:06.720 --> 13:12.960
No, I don't know. The outside leg always.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.080
Yes. Then,

13:22.760 --> 13:24.280
into the middle.

13:29.420 --> 13:30.380
Here.

13:40.440 --> 13:46.560
This is like over the music, the end, well

13:46.560 --> 13:50.700
you know the music anyway. Anyway. From

13:50.700 --> 13:51.080
here.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.040
From the place where we were just now,

13:59.120 --> 13:59.400
Matthias.

14:44.500 --> 14:49.200
 Let's go.

15:50.260 --> 15:50.780
Matthias?

15:54.500 --> 15:58.220
But really, Ruchi too, right? Yes, I like

15:58.220 --> 16:02.280
it. I like it, yes.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.020
Okay. Okay. I don't know about after you.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.220
Thank you.

17:18.300 --> 17:18.380
. . .

17:32.940 --> 17:48.360
How are you? Ump 75 OK.

18:16.940 --> 18:21.480
 You wanted to mark it.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.340


19:46.940 --> 19:48.340


20:46.940 --> 20:48.340


21:16.940 --> 21:18.340


22:16.780 --> 22:18.140


23:08.900 --> 23:11.700
Thank you.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.380
Thank you.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.140
Actually, I didn't know how long it takes,

23:56.240 --> 23:58.320
but I thought if we start something, we

23:58.320 --> 24:00.400
have to kind of go through the whole

24:00.400 --> 24:02.280
thing. It's terribly hard. It's really,

24:02.420 --> 24:04.960
and I think they did fantastic. And

24:04.960 --> 24:06.680
actually, I thought we'd do something

24:06.680 --> 24:08.720
else, but it's almost the opposite, very

24:08.720 --> 24:11.660
light and very nice, very funny, but I

24:11.660 --> 24:14.660
think it got too late. So I thought I just

24:14.660 --> 24:16.440
I just wanted to do two very different

24:16.440 --> 24:18.620
things, but it's already... To warm down.

24:20.980 --> 24:23.120
To warm down. To warm down. To warm down.

24:23.120 --> 24:28.600
To warm down. Yeah? 1980s. It's too cold,

24:28.680 --> 24:31.580
so I think. I think it's too cold.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.860
I think they want to speak. It looks like

24:38.860 --> 24:41.180
we only have three seats, so we'll have to

24:41.180 --> 24:42.800
play musical chairs. Yeah, but anyway, you

24:42.800 --> 24:44.160
have to, you have to... We'll let you cool

24:44.160 --> 24:44.640
down. I think we'll let you cool down. But

24:44.640 --> 24:46.400
the, the, the, .

24:50.580 --> 24:54.340
Is it on? Yeah. More chairs? Yeah, why

24:54.340 --> 24:55.440
don't you bring out a couple more chairs.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.680
As you can see, this is a, actually,

25:24.680 --> 25:28.280
you're participating, you're spectating in

25:28.280 --> 25:30.780
the context of an improvised three-act

25:30.780 --> 25:35.820
play. And this is the second act, and it's

25:35.820 --> 25:37.900
going to be a divided act in the sense

25:37.900 --> 25:40.720
that the first part of it will consist in

25:40.720 --> 25:44.800
a sort of, a fairly informal conversation

25:44.800 --> 25:47.460
between myself and Pina Bausch, and

25:47.460 --> 25:49.420
hopefully the dancers once they've

25:49.420 --> 25:52.180
recovered from their efforts. And then in

25:52.180 --> 25:53.560
the second half I'm going to just open up

25:53.560 --> 25:55.600
the floor to a general conversation so

25:55.600 --> 25:59.040
members of the audience will be invited to

25:59.040 --> 26:03.260
ask their questions and then the third act

26:03.260 --> 26:06.340
the triumphal act will be where we feed

26:06.340 --> 26:10.240
you out in the courtyard out here as a

26:10.240 --> 26:13.600
conclusion of the event and it is meant as

26:13.600 --> 26:15.960
a genuine third act in the sense that it

26:15.960 --> 26:17.880
is participatory but it's participatory

26:17.880 --> 26:19.940
not adjusting the gastronomical sense it's

26:19.940 --> 26:23.080
your opportunity to actually meet with

26:23.080 --> 26:26.500
Pina Bausch herself, with the dancers who

26:26.500 --> 26:31.500
will be partaking of our repast with us. I

26:31.500 --> 26:34.280
thought as a kind of introduction to our

26:34.280 --> 26:36.680
conversation I would ask you, since the

26:36.680 --> 26:39.480
Rite of Spring is a piece that has long

26:39.480 --> 26:44.640
been a part of your career, and it is one

26:44.640 --> 26:46.440
of the central monuments in a sense in the

26:46.440 --> 26:50.160
history of modern dance. It's a piece of

26:50.160 --> 26:53.420
music and the choreographies of which have

26:53.420 --> 26:56.140
really marked the entire history of modern

26:56.140 --> 27:00.700
dance and it's also a dance and a piece of

27:00.700 --> 27:03.800
music that is so much built around the

27:03.800 --> 27:07.780
polarity of dance as associated with

27:07.780 --> 27:10.460
renewal on the one side with resurgent

27:10.460 --> 27:13.040
life and on the other side with depth,

27:13.220 --> 27:17.020
with expenditure. I was just curious as a

27:17.020 --> 27:19.460
sort of starting question to ask you what

27:19.460 --> 27:21.080
your personal relationship is to this

27:21.080 --> 27:22.620
piece. I mean in what sense is it a piece

27:22.620 --> 27:24.100
that you've returned to in the course of

27:24.100 --> 27:26.040
your career as a dancer and a

27:26.040 --> 27:28.700
choreographer? You mean why we are doing

27:28.700 --> 27:31.520
it again or something? Yeah. Actually we

27:31.520 --> 27:35.260
keep a very big repertoire. I do every

27:35.260 --> 27:40.920
day, every year a new work and we perform

27:40.920 --> 27:44.980
about 12, 14 different evenings from the

27:44.980 --> 27:48.140
repertoire in a year. And sometimes

27:48.140 --> 27:50.640
because of, I don't know for certain

27:50.640 --> 27:54.200
because of where we travel or because a

27:54.200 --> 27:56.340
dancer is leaving or something, so we lose

27:56.340 --> 27:58.820
a piece. And then every year I try also to

27:58.820 --> 28:01.000
have one of the old ones. But Sacre we

28:01.000 --> 28:03.300
always carry with us the whole time. We

28:03.300 --> 28:06.240
always perform it from time to time. It

28:06.240 --> 28:08.340
was always there.

28:11.380 --> 28:15.900
And in a way it's also very healthy, I

28:15.900 --> 28:18.640
think, for the company, the new ones.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.920
Everybody, you know, have to kind of go

28:21.920 --> 28:25.340
through many different things. The other

28:25.340 --> 28:26.880
way, many people sometimes say, and I say,

28:26.940 --> 28:29.160
why don't you do another Sacre? And they

28:29.160 --> 28:31.120
say, but we do Sacre, you know? So it

28:31.120 --> 28:33.660
makes me also with each new work, I have

28:33.660 --> 28:36.220
to open another door. So if I keep my own

28:36.220 --> 28:39.300
works like they are, I have to always like

28:39.300 --> 28:41.420
go somewhere else, what I think is very

28:41.420 --> 28:44.280
good to do. But in the course of your

28:44.280 --> 28:47.680
performance of it, do you alter the basic

28:47.680 --> 28:51.580
way in which you present the piece, the

28:51.580 --> 28:55.740
different aspects of the choreography

28:55.740 --> 28:57.560
itself, or has it remained relatively

28:57.560 --> 28:59.660
stable in the course of the years? No, I

28:59.660 --> 29:02.600
tried to do what I did in the beginning.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.560
And the first performance, it goes back to

29:06.560 --> 29:12.320
the mid-70s? Yes, 76 or something, no? 77.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.280
I haven't seen the original staging of it,

29:19.360 --> 29:21.080
but in the ordinary staging, you were

29:21.080 --> 29:22.500
referring to the fact that this is a real

29:22.500 --> 29:24.480
floor, but you would ordinarily perform it

29:24.480 --> 29:27.920
with loam or peat moss. Yeah, this is with

29:27.920 --> 29:32.540
turf. I don't know, turf. And so it's a

29:32.540 --> 29:34.520
completely different experience. I mean,

29:34.560 --> 29:36.860
there are many, many dancers involved in

29:36.860 --> 29:39.320
this piece, and so it's really, and the

29:39.320 --> 29:43.380
music is incredible. It's so strong. It's

29:43.380 --> 29:46.620
very, very energetic. So this is just a

29:46.620 --> 29:49.260
little bit from the end, you know, but and

29:49.260 --> 29:53.560
before it's so it's but what I like about

29:53.560 --> 30:00.940
I mean the the earth, the talk, because it

30:00.940 --> 30:03.800
the effect it has on a body. First of all

30:03.800 --> 30:06.760
also it's completely different to it's all

30:06.760 --> 30:09.040
about the earth. Also the starting I mean

30:09.040 --> 30:11.300
why they are arriving there and all this

30:11.300 --> 30:13.700
but but also because when they start

30:13.700 --> 30:15.920
sweating and moving, so it sticks onto

30:15.920 --> 30:18.020
them. So when they fall, they are

30:18.020 --> 30:21.280
everywhere full of earth. So you should

30:21.280 --> 30:23.740
see them when they are all after the, when

30:23.740 --> 30:25.820
they come for buying, it's like they are

30:25.820 --> 30:27.700
all over with earth and they look

30:27.700 --> 30:29.180
fantastic, I think.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.160
It's interesting that you mentioned that

30:34.160 --> 30:35.780
because in the piece that you were

30:35.780 --> 30:37.600
performing at Zellerbach, Nelken

30:37.600 --> 30:40.320
carnations, the stage is covered with

30:40.320 --> 30:42.320
carnations, with hundreds and hundreds of

30:42.320 --> 30:44.940
fresh carnations and similarly there not

30:44.940 --> 30:48.980
fresh i'm sorry they look fresh from the

30:48.980 --> 30:52.420
audience but in any case the the sort of

30:52.420 --> 30:54.180
interaction between the bodies and the

30:54.180 --> 30:56.780
support this you know natural support is a

30:56.780 --> 31:01.180
central feature of the piece is it what

31:01.180 --> 31:05.200
how did it first the the notion of using

31:05.200 --> 31:07.860
these kinds of of you know they're not not

31:07.860 --> 31:09.660
natural landscapes obviously, but they're

31:09.660 --> 31:13.500
ways of transforming the stage first arise

31:13.500 --> 31:14.120
in your work.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.660
Well of course when it's already, it's

31:21.660 --> 31:26.400
usually a later moment when to think about

31:26.400 --> 31:29.780
on what is the stage like, because first

31:29.780 --> 31:35.560
always only when I know in what kind of

31:35.560 --> 31:39.320
direction this piece will go then it's

31:39.320 --> 31:43.980
only possible to speak well how what could

31:43.980 --> 31:48.180
be I mean and I mean myself I like very

31:48.180 --> 31:51.920
much the experience that you have you have

31:51.920 --> 31:54.420
to pay an attention to something. So it's

31:54.420 --> 31:58.380
always a different experience, you know,

31:58.420 --> 32:02.020
like it's very central in a way. Also we

32:02.020 --> 32:05.040
have a piece like you come in the opera

32:05.040 --> 32:08.960
house and the whole stage is through the

32:08.960 --> 32:11.900
walls is grass, green grass, or another

32:11.900 --> 32:15.280
piece it's water. And of course all this

32:15.280 --> 32:18.460
is, there's so many things, you know, with

32:18.460 --> 32:20.780
the grass it's a different smell, it's

32:20.780 --> 32:23.600
silence, there are sometimes mosquitoes

32:23.600 --> 32:27.620
and little things, and it changes with the

32:27.620 --> 32:30.720
images, it gets another, it gets something

32:30.720 --> 32:34.300
else, so it can, with certain things, so

32:34.300 --> 32:38.280
it is a grass change and you look at the

32:38.280 --> 32:39.960
grass completely different, you look at

32:39.960 --> 32:44.260
the grass new, like in a place where it

32:44.260 --> 32:47.640
didn't belong. Also, or the experience

32:47.640 --> 32:51.580
when things in water happen because it's

32:51.580 --> 32:54.860
like a mirror in a way. All the dresses

32:54.860 --> 32:58.480
are wet, the clothes get heavy, they are

32:58.480 --> 33:02.040
freezing. It makes certain music, it makes

33:02.040 --> 33:05.000
a lot of noise. You can splash the water,

33:05.140 --> 33:06.960
you can do all kinds of things with the

33:06.960 --> 33:09.660
water. And it has so many different

33:09.660 --> 33:15.260
meanings too. And so for me, all this

33:15.260 --> 33:18.460
together means a lot. Not only the

33:18.460 --> 33:21.100
movement, but for me the space, the music,

33:21.380 --> 33:27.720
the audience, also everything I think I'd

33:27.720 --> 33:31.900
like to join

33:31.900 --> 33:35.540
or something. Speaking of that, I mean

33:35.540 --> 33:38.080
frequently, as was the case at Zellerbach

33:38.080 --> 33:41.060
for instance, your company is performing

33:41.060 --> 33:44.440
in fairly traditional window box type

33:44.440 --> 33:46.440
stages. I mean stages where there's a

33:46.440 --> 33:48.760
separation between audience and

33:48.760 --> 33:50.520
performance space. That's a little bit

33:50.520 --> 33:52.880
less true here where we're in a gymnasium

33:52.880 --> 33:54.580
which essentially is used for athletic

33:54.580 --> 33:56.760
events, but other kinds of events as well.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.420
What I mean for you, what is an ideal

34:01.420 --> 34:03.440
performance situation given exactly the

34:03.440 --> 34:06.860
concept of spectacle that's inclusive that

34:06.860 --> 34:12.240
you were just describing? I think it had

34:12.240 --> 34:15.000
to do with where I was. I mean this was a

34:15.000 --> 34:21.540
fantastic possibility and these pieces are

34:21.540 --> 34:25.560
made also for being in a normal theater

34:25.560 --> 34:32.360
because I mean it's even you know even to

34:32.360 --> 34:34.980
put water on the stage it means for me I

34:34.980 --> 34:37.260
like the water in the opera house. It's

34:37.260 --> 34:39.660
already it means something so if you put

34:39.660 --> 34:41.960
water somewhere else it's not the same but

34:41.960 --> 34:44.460
in the opera house it's special. So it's

34:44.460 --> 34:47.920
already, so I think it's already the

34:47.920 --> 34:51.620
switch is, in this case, you know, I never

34:51.620 --> 34:54.400
had the possibility to do different, but

34:54.400 --> 34:57.540
not because, not only the possibilities,

34:57.800 --> 34:59.880
but because we also, we are traveling a

34:59.880 --> 35:02.260
lot, so it's for us also important, this

35:02.260 --> 35:04.840
work, they need a certain space and a

35:04.840 --> 35:08.760
certain size and possibilities,

35:11.620 --> 35:15.100
If I would do a piece in a certain space,

35:15.300 --> 35:17.600
that means it can't travel. It's also

35:17.600 --> 35:22.000
complicated, you know. I was curious about

35:22.000 --> 35:23.960
that because in a certain tradition of,

35:24.520 --> 35:26.760
well in some of the cases that really the

35:26.760 --> 35:28.680
founding, the inaugural cases in the

35:28.680 --> 35:31.660
history of dance, particularly the strain

35:31.660 --> 35:33.960
in dance theater that leads into

35:33.960 --> 35:36.600
expression dance, dance, the notion of

35:36.600 --> 35:38.800
outdoor performance was absolutely central

35:38.800 --> 35:41.660
to the whole sense of dance's social

35:41.660 --> 35:42.000
mission.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.720
So your particular variation on having

35:48.720 --> 35:50.500
grass in the opera house or water in the

35:50.500 --> 35:51.500
opera house seems like a particularly

35:51.500 --> 35:55.460
ironic twist. Sometimes we performed also

35:55.460 --> 35:57.740
outdoor, of course, but this were also,

35:57.820 --> 35:59.920
but there's is only with pieces possible

35:59.920 --> 36:05.040
which are having nothing important what is

36:05.040 --> 36:07.680
used from hanging or certain things and

36:07.680 --> 36:13.940
also and it depends on the space. One

36:13.940 --> 36:17.340
question I wanted to ask you that seems to

36:17.340 --> 36:19.920
be a really striking feature of your the

36:19.920 --> 36:23.000
way in which you construct scenes and your

36:23.000 --> 36:27.200
different performances is the the emphasis

36:27.200 --> 36:29.760
on bodies falling to the ground, the

36:29.760 --> 36:31.260
contact between bodies and the ground. You

36:31.260 --> 36:33.960
just mentioned in the case of your staging

36:33.960 --> 36:37.540
of the Rite of Spring, the importance for

36:37.540 --> 36:40.240
you that the bodies bear the trace of the

36:40.240 --> 36:44.560
support on which they perform. Whereas so

36:44.560 --> 36:46.780
much of classical ballet, and a great deal

36:46.780 --> 36:50.920
of modern and contemporary dance focuses

36:50.920 --> 36:53.840
so much on aerial effects. Is that

36:53.840 --> 36:57.120
something that you do a lot of thinking

36:57.120 --> 37:00.260
about it seems like such a strong current

37:00.260 --> 37:03.940
in your work. I think this is in each work

37:03.940 --> 37:06.460
is it's different it's very different but

37:06.460 --> 37:09.400
I I think in in the Rite of Spring of

37:09.400 --> 37:13.280
course I I feel it's it's very the the

37:13.280 --> 37:17.200
music it's I think the music is telling me

37:17.200 --> 37:22.140
that. You're just taking dictation. Yes in

37:22.140 --> 37:26.320
that case yes I mean this is with Sacre

37:26.320 --> 37:30.340
and also a few other pieces which when I

37:30.340 --> 37:34.980
really saw this incredible strength and

37:34.980 --> 37:38.240
this feeling what was in this music where

37:38.240 --> 37:40.400
I felt I have something to do with. I

37:40.400 --> 37:44.940
wanted very much to try to do. But other

37:44.940 --> 37:49.960
works, they are not fixed. It s like I

37:49.960 --> 37:53.580
take many different different musics and I

37:53.580 --> 37:56.260
make a new work and that's completely

37:56.260 --> 37:58.500
different then. And it depends also the

37:58.500 --> 38:00.640
big influence on the dancers also, the

38:00.640 --> 38:03.520
people which are in the company. It also

38:03.520 --> 38:06.960
has an influence and also in which time we

38:06.960 --> 38:09.300
are living. So it's not just doing a

38:09.300 --> 38:12.100
choreography but I think being aware of

38:12.100 --> 38:16.240
the feelings we are all having or what we

38:16.240 --> 38:18.100
are knowing or all all these kind of

38:18.100 --> 38:20.880
things, it all takes part.

38:24.100 --> 38:28.600
And if what we had seen this evening was

38:28.600 --> 38:32.720
instead of a rehearsal of a piece that

38:32.720 --> 38:36.580
you've choreographed and represented many,

38:36.720 --> 38:39.320
many times, if you were in the process of

38:39.320 --> 38:41.580
developing a new piece, what would have

38:41.580 --> 38:43.520
been different about what the audience

38:43.520 --> 38:48.060
experienced tonight? I mean, this is also

38:48.060 --> 38:50.360
quite unusual because usually we don't do

38:50.360 --> 38:52.360
this. I mean, that I'm teaching this solo

38:52.360 --> 38:55.140
to now all the dancers, this was like also

38:55.140 --> 38:56.420
an exception, I must say.

39:00.360 --> 39:04.200
Well, it's of course, what is very

39:04.200 --> 39:06.160
different.

39:07.460 --> 39:10.300
I mean, here you can still you feel what

39:10.300 --> 39:14.420
is sacred. But in the other works, there

39:14.420 --> 39:17.120
are so many little different stories

39:17.120 --> 39:20.120
inside or thoughts or images or whatever,

39:20.300 --> 39:25.960
what comes out of it. And each of the

39:25.960 --> 39:30.380
dancers, each one is in a different way

39:30.380 --> 39:32.680
important and also their certain

39:32.680 --> 39:37.160
personality and the way how the influence

39:37.160 --> 39:40.160
and also they each have their own dances,

39:40.300 --> 39:45.140
their own different way of dancing and

39:45.140 --> 39:48.640
choreography. So that's completely, it's

39:48.640 --> 39:51.100
very complicated. I mean, it's just like

39:51.900 --> 39:56.620
the best is to see it. That's always true.

39:57.740 --> 40:00.380
But I guess what I was curious about is in

40:00.380 --> 40:02.040
terms of your working method, when you're

40:02.040 --> 40:05.820
developing a new piece, What's the degree

40:05.820 --> 40:11.480
to which you have a fairly clear concept

40:11.480 --> 40:14.600
of what the shape of a particular passage

40:14.600 --> 40:17.500
should be versus what happens by accident,

40:17.740 --> 40:22.620
by serendipity, by virtue, by dint of

40:22.620 --> 40:26.960
improvisation? I think that is a very big

40:26.960 --> 40:29.320
change from when I started the way how I

40:29.320 --> 40:32.540
work now. In the beginning when I came

40:32.540 --> 40:39.720
having this company in Bukhara, I always

40:39.720 --> 40:42.800
tried to prepare everything, to be very

40:42.800 --> 40:45.220
prepared and planned and thought

40:45.220 --> 40:47.960
everything because I was scared. I was

40:47.960 --> 40:50.700
afraid somebody asked me, what do we do?

40:50.800 --> 40:54.100
And I said, I don't know. So I was

40:54.100 --> 40:58.140
thinking of everything and then I never

40:58.140 --> 41:00.340
come into this situation. I was terribly

41:00.340 --> 41:03.840
scared to say or to speak about it because

41:03.840 --> 41:09.080
for me, in one way I don't find the right

41:09.080 --> 41:11.420
word. In another way, I always feel like

41:11.420 --> 41:14.300
if I say something too important, I never

41:14.300 --> 41:17.360
can reach what I say. I mean, it's better

41:17.360 --> 41:19.100
I don't say nothing and hopefully

41:19.100 --> 41:21.720
something arrives. you know.

41:25.540 --> 41:29.900
But already in the beginning I felt

41:29.900 --> 41:33.840
sometimes you know you work and certainly

41:34.640 --> 41:37.520
something happened in the rehearsal, you

41:37.520 --> 41:39.420
see something very little but has nothing

41:39.420 --> 41:42.540
to do with what you have planned and you

41:42.540 --> 41:44.700
don't know exactly why is it so important.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.680
Why is it It's so important. Then you have

41:47.680 --> 41:50.180
to think, I mean, you have to think what

41:50.180 --> 41:53.020
you do. I mean, is this what you think,

41:53.060 --> 41:55.100
why, what you like most certainly so much

41:55.100 --> 41:58.000
and interest you, do you follow this or

41:58.000 --> 42:00.140
you follow your plan? So what I did, I

42:00.140 --> 42:02.600
followed always that. I left my plans

42:02.600 --> 42:03.220
behind.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.880
That is also very difficult.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.960
You go somewhere where you don't know it

42:16.960 --> 42:19.940
brings you. So in a way you have to just

42:19.940 --> 42:26.180
trust it and actually we are there, the

42:26.180 --> 42:29.000
company and me, and life is there. And now

42:29.000 --> 42:32.400
what do we do? We speak about life, about

42:32.400 --> 42:35.360
love, about everything what is important,

42:35.360 --> 42:39.540
of course

42:39.540 --> 42:43.680
in the beginning of the years I had I

42:43.680 --> 42:48.200
judged some like I did if you gain you of

42:48.200 --> 42:51.840
Taurus from look an opera and it like a

42:51.840 --> 42:54.820
dance opera I did it just with dancers and

42:54.820 --> 42:57.180
also offers in a really good I did blue

42:57.180 --> 43:02.340
beard I did soccer and and the seven

43:02.340 --> 43:05.240
deadly sins. But at the same time already

43:05.240 --> 43:08.720
I did other works. I just things I like.

43:09.140 --> 43:13.120
And because also, you see these pieces

43:13.120 --> 43:14.720
which I was just telling you, that means

43:14.720 --> 43:17.200
there is like a solo part in it. There is

43:17.200 --> 43:19.940
a main figure. You know, if you give me

43:19.940 --> 43:23.860
the or here you have, I mean there's

43:23.860 --> 43:25.480
everybody in the choreography is very

43:25.480 --> 43:27.700
important, but still there is this girl on

43:27.700 --> 43:31.300
the end. It's the main part. and also in

43:31.300 --> 43:32.880
Bluebeard, you have Bluebeard and Judith.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.120
But then I had so many beautiful dancers.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.680
They are all so different personalities

43:37.680 --> 43:40.200
and so fantastic and each one very

43:40.200 --> 43:43.640
different. So I wanted very much to create

43:43.640 --> 43:48.020
something for them. So it started to be a

43:48.020 --> 43:52.760
completely different work. And I think we

43:52.760 --> 43:57.760
are speaking much more about in this work,

43:57.880 --> 44:02.880
heroes in that way don't exist. It's just

44:02.880 --> 44:09.500
like, it's talking about us. I mean, not

44:09.500 --> 44:12.880
us personally, not private. I don't mean

44:12.880 --> 44:19.340
this. And the way how to do this is of

44:19.340 --> 44:21.220
course each choreographer has to find

44:21.220 --> 44:25.480
their own way how to find, how to do this.

44:25.660 --> 44:28.920
Because when there is no piece, is no

44:28.920 --> 44:31.640
music, is no set, where do you start? You

44:31.640 --> 44:36.020
have to find a kind of way, you know, like

44:36.020 --> 44:39.360
I never did start from the beginning. I

44:39.360 --> 44:43.620
start with question, like maybe sometimes

44:43.620 --> 44:45.980
question I have to myself or other

44:45.980 --> 44:49.360
question and because I know what I want

44:49.360 --> 44:52.520
but I don't, has no shape, has no words.

44:53.580 --> 44:56.980
So but how can I find, how can I shape it,

44:57.020 --> 44:58.980
this what I really know what I'm looking

44:58.980 --> 45:01.520
for because it's really, it's so clear

45:01.520 --> 45:03.740
what I'm looking for but I couldn't say

45:03.740 --> 45:09.160
it, you know. So I start

45:09.160 --> 45:13.060
with many, many questions. And each one,

45:13.160 --> 45:16.600
each member in the company, they have this

45:16.600 --> 45:18.860
question, they sing, and then you think

45:18.860 --> 45:20.800
you are not in a dance studio, they sit

45:20.800 --> 45:24.720
and sing and do the pencil. And then each

45:24.720 --> 45:27.480
one is doing something, or maybe not,

45:27.620 --> 45:30.620
maybe they tell me tomorrow, or like like

45:30.620 --> 45:34.600
this, and they can do some movement or

45:34.600 --> 45:36.540
something that comes to their mind, or

45:36.540 --> 45:42.440
talking or singing or whatever. And this I

45:42.440 --> 45:45.520
do actually many, many, like for weeks,

45:45.660 --> 45:49.000
and also bringing maybe other ideas into

45:49.000 --> 45:51.520
it, but the questions are all around

45:51.520 --> 45:57.460
something, kind of. But these These weeks

45:57.460 --> 46:03.180
are just like making material or try to

46:03.180 --> 46:06.220
find material because actually it will be

46:06.220 --> 46:10.380
maybe 5% of what we are all doing maybe

46:10.380 --> 46:15.140
will arrive in the work. So the final

46:15.140 --> 46:18.220
process to when to start, I mean, it's

46:18.220 --> 46:23.140
much, much later and also never from from

46:23.140 --> 46:24.540
the beginning it's something so

46:24.540 --> 46:27.400
complicated and so delicate when you try

46:27.400 --> 46:30.040
to put two little things together. And

46:30.040 --> 46:31.840
when you try that little bit with another

46:31.840 --> 46:33.960
one, it's completely different. It means

46:33.960 --> 46:35.420
something else. It feels something

46:35.420 --> 46:37.840
different. And when you add a music even

46:37.840 --> 46:41.880
too, it's so complicated and it's so rich

46:41.880 --> 46:44.460
and it's endless and possibilities. So you

46:44.460 --> 46:44.820
have to

46:54.380 --> 46:55.780
Thank you.
