WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:03.000
.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.740
My name is Elvira Prieto. I'm a sophomore

00:26.740 --> 00:30.240
in human biology here. I'm from Reedley,

00:30.360 --> 00:32.060
California, which is a small agricultural

00:32.060 --> 00:34.280
town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents

00:34.280 --> 00:36.260
are migrant workers, and I've worked in

00:36.260 --> 00:38.180
the fields with them all my life, up until

00:38.180 --> 00:43.320
I started coming to school. My name is Eva

00:43.320 --> 00:46.240
Silva. I'm a senior majoring in human

00:46.240 --> 00:49.320
biology with an emphasis on education in

00:49.320 --> 00:51.980
the diverse classroom. And I'm from

00:51.980 --> 00:54.840
Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a

00:54.840 --> 00:59.040
math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado

00:59.040 --> 01:01.420
and I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano

01:01.420 --> 01:05.400
Studies. I'm from a town in San Diego

01:05.400 --> 01:12.040
called Escondido and what else? That's it

01:12.040 --> 01:17.200
for now. My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna. I

01:17.200 --> 01:19.900
am a senior majoring in public policy with

01:19.900 --> 01:24.100
a focus on on education. And I'm from

01:24.100 --> 01:28.120
Burbank, California, and I'm going to be a

01:28.120 --> 01:31.180
social studies high school teacher.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.580
Do you want to ask some questions here as

01:38.580 --> 01:42.340
to how this started? In your own words,

01:42.460 --> 01:44.860
how did it start? How did this hunter

01:44.860 --> 01:45.980
strike start and why? Why?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.040
How did it start? Speak to us as if we

01:53.040 --> 01:56.260
don't know. Okay. Speak to me like you do.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.240
Well, I guess it was a buildup of a lot of

01:59.240 --> 02:01.280
different things that have been happening,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.920
not only on this campus, but overall in

02:03.920 --> 02:07.460
this nation with the status of Chicanos

02:07.460 --> 02:10.580
and Chicanas in the United States, in the

02:10.580 --> 02:14.380
universities and everywhere else. So, you

02:14.380 --> 02:18.760
know, I guess I can run down, like, since

02:18.760 --> 02:20.120
my freshman year, so many things have

02:20.120 --> 02:22.080
happened, the closing down of the Office

02:22.080 --> 02:26.320
of Chicano Affairs, and then with all the

02:26.320 --> 02:28.140
threats, with the budget cuts to the

02:28.140 --> 02:31.020
ethnic centers, and just these attacks on

02:31.020 --> 02:33.840
the theme houses, on the ethnic centers,

02:33.900 --> 02:37.060
and everything else, and then the laying

02:37.060 --> 02:41.240
off of Cecilia Burciaga. I mean everything

02:41.240 --> 02:43.760
just like piled down piled down and so

02:43.760 --> 02:46.200
many things are happening that we say wait

02:46.200 --> 02:48.060
we need to do something about it and we

02:48.060 --> 02:49.960
need to change what's going on because

02:49.960 --> 02:54.740
nothing's happening that we want to happen

02:55.480 --> 02:58.340
I'm tired, I'm sorry. No, you sound good.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.540
Some people wonder why you would need to

03:00.540 --> 03:02.980
take a drastic measure like this. I think

03:02.980 --> 03:05.620
you'll say why didn't you? Because the

03:05.620 --> 03:07.560
administration has been very, whenever

03:07.560 --> 03:10.600
we've had like meetings and townhouse

03:10.600 --> 03:11.920
meetings or whatever, get togethers with

03:11.920 --> 03:15.060
any of the administrators, we don't get

03:15.060 --> 03:17.680
any results that we're happy with. And so

03:17.680 --> 03:19.080
it seemed to me like for them to really

03:19.080 --> 03:21.240
understand how extreme the situation is on

03:21.240 --> 03:23.700
this campus and how extreme things are

03:23.700 --> 03:25.800
outside in terms of immigrant bashing and

03:25.800 --> 03:29.480
just the way that people in Ispa Lo Alto

03:29.480 --> 03:31.960
are, that it was maybe the only way that

03:31.960 --> 03:33.700
they would, I don't know if it would touch

03:33.700 --> 03:35.200
their heart or if they would just stop to

03:35.200 --> 03:37.380
think about it or if we could get enough

03:37.380 --> 03:39.520
bad press for this university so that they

03:39.520 --> 03:41.140
could finally just really think about it.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.960
Because otherwise they weren't paying

03:42.960 --> 03:44.780
attention. It was just like everything had

03:44.780 --> 03:46.860
to go business as usual and there seemed

03:46.860 --> 03:49.260
to be this idea about hierarchy here that

03:49.260 --> 03:51.300
it was from top down it was what they said

03:51.300 --> 03:53.480
first and then if we could deal with that

03:53.480 --> 03:56.280
if we as students could deal with what the

03:56.280 --> 03:57.880
university wanted well then that was fine

03:57.880 --> 03:59.840
and if we couldn't that's too bad because

03:59.840 --> 04:01.800
they're at their position because you know

04:01.800 --> 04:05.540
they earned it or whatever yeah because

04:05.540 --> 04:09.300
meeting after meeting like you didn't get

04:09.300 --> 04:12.240
anything concrete from meeting with them

04:12.240 --> 04:14.380
every single time it was just okay I'll

04:14.380 --> 04:15.580
give I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7,

04:15.600 --> 04:17.820
I'll give you a meeting from 5.30 to 6 or

04:17.820 --> 04:22.000
whatever. We've tried their methods. We've

04:22.000 --> 04:25.380
tried their methods of working things out.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.940
And their methods are to draw things out

04:27.940 --> 04:31.420
for as long as possible in order to not

04:31.420 --> 04:33.200
give us things. At least, you know, they

04:33.200 --> 04:35.240
may say differently, but that's what it

04:35.240 --> 04:38.540
feels like. And it's ridiculous to have to

04:38.540 --> 04:42.160
spend... I'm sorry I'm slow, but I'm a

04:42.160 --> 04:44.840
little bit tired. It's ridiculous to spend

04:44.840 --> 04:46.480
so much time just talking and talking

04:46.480 --> 04:49.320
about things. And they're trying to tire

04:49.320 --> 04:53.500
us out with just talking. So that's what

04:53.500 --> 04:55.720
it had to come to. And when people are not

04:55.720 --> 04:58.560
heard, and this happens in society at

04:58.560 --> 05:01.700
large, when people are not heard, yeah, I

05:01.700 --> 05:04.480
don't know if I want to say abnormal

05:04.480 --> 05:07.000
behaviors, but behaviors that are not

05:07.000 --> 05:12.460
normal are what happen. And yeah, this is

05:12.460 --> 05:15.000
not normal. This is not normal behavior

05:15.000 --> 05:20.840
for us to be not eating. But you know... I

05:20.840 --> 05:22.840
really like to eat. Yeah, we like to eat.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.520
And I emphasize, you know, why are

05:27.520 --> 05:29.360
Chicanos in prison? Why are Chicanos in

05:29.360 --> 05:32.160
poverty? That's not normal. That's not

05:32.160 --> 05:34.980
normal for people. But because of society,

05:35.200 --> 05:38.080
that's how we are. We've waited long

05:38.080 --> 05:40.740
enough for this. I mean, I know the

05:40.740 --> 05:42.240
administration is probably thinking, well,

05:42.260 --> 05:43.900
you know, be patient and these changes

05:43.900 --> 05:46.240
will happen. But we've been patient long

05:46.240 --> 05:49.660
enough. And, you know, the Chicano Studies

05:49.660 --> 05:53.280
major has been, was envisioned back in the

05:53.280 --> 05:58.360
70s, even the 60s. And we've been waiting

05:58.360 --> 06:00.640
since then. And it's about time that we

06:00.640 --> 06:04.300
get recognized. You know, Chicanos are the

06:04.300 --> 06:08.200
biggest, are coming to be a majority in

06:08.200 --> 06:11.280
California. you know, maybe even in the

06:11.280 --> 06:14.100
whole country after a while, but I mean

06:14.100 --> 06:15.680
it's about time that our issues get

06:15.680 --> 06:18.380
recognized and that other people just

06:18.380 --> 06:22.080
realize that we're not going to go away.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.400
And if they don't educate themselves about

06:24.400 --> 06:27.940
us, then it's just going to be worse for

06:27.940 --> 06:31.340
them. Julia, you co-authored a really

06:31.340 --> 06:33.320
beautiful poem entitled Somos Mujeres.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.040
What for you What do you think is the

06:35.040 --> 06:37.820
significance of having four Chicanas

06:37.820 --> 06:41.540
taking the Vanguard role in this movement,

06:41.760 --> 06:43.200
which is really bigger than this campus?

06:44.940 --> 06:48.860
For me, I mean... I don't know. We didn't

06:48.860 --> 06:50.740
really realize it was four women until

06:50.740 --> 06:53.880
somebody pointed it out to us. I mean, we

06:53.880 --> 06:56.280
knew it was girls, but we didn't see it

06:56.280 --> 06:59.200
like, you know, oh, there's no guys here,

06:59.360 --> 07:06.080
and what's up with the guys? but I don't

07:06.080 --> 07:07.460
know I mean we have a lot of supporters

07:07.460 --> 07:09.400
that are male and maybe they didn't say

07:09.400 --> 07:10.800
they're gonna go for the long run but

07:10.800 --> 07:13.400
they've been you know there the whole time

07:13.400 --> 07:16.340
everybody like has had has their roles and

07:16.340 --> 07:19.700
it's like there's some people that are the

07:19.700 --> 07:21.360
negotiators there's people that are

07:21.360 --> 07:23.300
security over here there's like everybody

07:23.300 --> 07:27.180
has a roles and you know we're not the the

07:27.180 --> 07:29.160
most important because if it wasn't for

07:29.160 --> 07:31.180
them then you know nobody would be

07:31.180 --> 07:33.080
listening to us or whatever and there's

07:33.080 --> 07:34.860
other people that have been fasting also

07:34.860 --> 07:38.220
like Felipe sitting over there again he's

07:38.220 --> 07:40.320
been fasting these three days with us as

07:40.320 --> 07:41.400
well and like there's people that

07:41.400 --> 07:43.540
committed to three days and others that do

07:43.540 --> 07:46.280
one one day cycles to show their support

07:46.280 --> 07:50.140
and solidarity it's true there are a lot

07:50.140 --> 07:53.360
of males that are doing really important

07:53.360 --> 07:54.840
stuff in terms of really trying you know

07:54.840 --> 07:56.580
like with the rest of the women also

07:56.580 --> 07:58.480
trying to take care of us and and trying

07:58.480 --> 08:00.000
to watch out for this, and they're just

08:00.000 --> 08:02.600
constantly looking out to see what we need

08:02.600 --> 08:05.000
or what needs to be done for the whole

08:05.000 --> 08:06.780
group. And so it's, I don't know, I don't

08:06.780 --> 08:08.900
know that it's specifically a female thing

08:08.900 --> 08:11.260
to be fasting or anything like that. Yeah,

08:11.280 --> 08:12.600
because I think... Because everybody

08:12.600 --> 08:14.540
really does have their own role, and

08:14.540 --> 08:16.500
everybody's been really supportive, and

08:16.500 --> 08:19.480
we're working together. It just so

08:19.480 --> 08:22.600
happened that we're the ones that... It

08:22.600 --> 08:28.700
was quite... that we're the ones that were

08:28.700 --> 08:33.800
ready mentally at this time to fast. And

08:33.800 --> 08:36.440
it just so happens that we're all women.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.300
People are calling us guerrillas and

08:40.300 --> 08:42.160
revolucionarias.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.180
That's fine. That's nice. That's really

08:49.180 --> 08:52.360
nice. But everybody's been revolutionary.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.240
And you know, it comes down to like... The

08:55.240 --> 08:56.740
focus should be on everybody. Yeah, it

08:56.740 --> 08:59.000
comes down to like what your, you know, I

08:59.000 --> 09:00.660
don't want to say your talents, because I

09:00.660 --> 09:02.360
don't think our talent is to be hungry,

09:02.500 --> 09:05.960
but... But pretty much like everybody is

09:05.960 --> 09:08.200
taking on the role that is best suited for

09:08.200 --> 09:08.600
themselves.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.640
There's Felipe! There's Felipe! You have

09:18.640 --> 09:20.240
all the things that you could have done,

09:20.280 --> 09:22.800
all the actions you could have taken. Why

09:22.800 --> 09:26.280
fasting? Why did you choose to fast?

09:29.340 --> 09:32.720
Well, it's obviously a really strong

09:32.720 --> 09:36.420
statement. It's something that is

09:36.420 --> 09:40.300
uncompromising and it's something that

09:40.300 --> 09:42.740
shows just how serious we are about these

09:42.740 --> 09:45.760
issues. They are issues that our fathers,

09:45.880 --> 09:47.720
grandfathers, and people way before us

09:47.720 --> 09:50.340
have fought for. We have a responsibility

09:50.340 --> 09:53.860
to those ancestors of ours to make sure

09:53.860 --> 09:55.400
that those dreams that they had, that

09:55.400 --> 09:58.780
vision they had, is fulfilled. We can't

09:58.780 --> 10:01.340
just, you know, it may be 20 years, 20,

10:01.460 --> 10:04.980
30, 20 years later from the Chicano

10:04.980 --> 10:06.780
movement that people think is dead, but

10:06.780 --> 10:08.340
it's not dead. We're here and we're living

10:08.340 --> 10:09.440
and we're the Chicano movement.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.860
Felipe, you just joined us, but actually

10:19.860 --> 10:21.240
you've been with us throughout this whole

10:21.240 --> 10:23.500
struggle from the beginning as was pointed

10:23.500 --> 10:25.420
out. Can you tell us a little bit about

10:25.420 --> 10:27.600
yourself, where you're from, and your

10:27.600 --> 10:30.980
reflection on this struggle? Sure. My name

10:30.980 --> 10:33.060
is Felipe Barragan. I'm a freshman,

10:33.300 --> 10:36.960
originally from Los Angeles, California.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.740
This struggle, I think for me, it's

10:41.740 --> 10:44.660
something that's very important because I

10:44.660 --> 10:47.720
went to high school in Watts and a lot of

10:47.720 --> 10:50.080
people know what Watts is like, 1965,

10:50.680 --> 10:53.500
Watts Rebellion, the Ninety-Two Riots.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.880
There I saw issues that the educational

10:57.880 --> 11:00.280
system for high school students and

11:00.280 --> 11:02.240
Chicanos, Latinos there wasn't addressing

11:02.240 --> 11:05.420
the real issues. Once I came here, I got a

11:05.420 --> 11:08.320
taste of it, I got a taste of Chicano

11:08.320 --> 11:10.820
studies and I found out how crucial that

11:10.820 --> 11:15.560
was. And I think that getting involved

11:15.560 --> 11:17.920
with the struggle is important for me to

11:17.920 --> 11:22.400
build the processes with which we learn to

11:22.400 --> 11:24.600
deal with inner city to wipe out the

11:24.600 --> 11:27.140
marginalization of our people.

11:30.060 --> 11:34.580
In terms of your actions, a lot of people

11:34.580 --> 11:36.860
are probably thinking that you came here

11:36.860 --> 11:39.120
to study and that you should be in the

11:39.120 --> 11:42.580
classroom, not protesting.

11:44.020 --> 11:47.460
So you're making a decision, because it is

11:47.460 --> 11:50.940
a pretty tough university to be at and

11:50.940 --> 11:53.160
there's a lot of demands and you're kind

11:53.160 --> 11:56.200
of out there really taking a big chance.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.800
How did you make that decision? See, I

12:00.800 --> 12:07.120
guess the main thing is, I never, when I

12:07.120 --> 12:09.580
came here I didn't want to come and just

12:09.580 --> 12:14.260
study and go to class and go back home,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.320
study, do my work and just concentrate on

12:16.320 --> 12:18.600
myself. While there's people out there,

12:18.680 --> 12:20.740
there's students in the high schools that

12:20.740 --> 12:21.700
are getting pushed pushed out of the

12:21.700 --> 12:24.500
schools, there's the farm workers that are

12:24.500 --> 12:26.100
getting treated badly, there's kids being

12:26.100 --> 12:27.500
born without hands because of the

12:27.500 --> 12:29.580
pesticides that they put on the grapes. I

12:29.580 --> 12:31.480
mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on

12:31.480 --> 12:33.440
my own work and not worry about what's

12:33.440 --> 12:37.140
going on because that's my people, that's

12:37.140 --> 12:39.160
my parents, that's my family, that's

12:39.160 --> 12:42.440
everybody. I wouldn't be able to live with

12:42.440 --> 12:44.640
myself without doing anything about it. I

12:44.640 --> 12:46.060
wouldn't be able to live with myself

12:46.060 --> 12:47.540
without just thinking about myself and my

12:47.540 --> 12:49.660
career and getting straight A's and and

12:49.660 --> 12:51.480
doing my resumes and stuff like that, I

12:51.480 --> 12:53.220
wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both

12:53.220 --> 12:56.600
things can be done. You know, so, like, I

12:56.600 --> 12:58.820
think that we're doing this so that, you

12:58.820 --> 13:00.580
know, later generations of Stanford

13:00.580 --> 13:03.120
Chicanos and Chicanas don't have to do it.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.820
Today we had, you know, little Chicanitas

13:05.820 --> 13:07.620
and Chicanitos from East Palo Alto come

13:07.620 --> 13:09.820
out and from a Vale Afro-Clerico group

13:09.820 --> 13:12.280
called Raíces de México, and they came out

13:12.280 --> 13:15.160
and they came out and supported us. You

13:15.160 --> 13:16.700
know, they're just little kids. I don't

13:16.700 --> 13:18.920
know, they're probably, like, from 5 to,

13:18.980 --> 13:21.400
like, 12. maybe and you know the reason

13:21.400 --> 13:23.300
we're doing this now and sacrificing our

13:23.300 --> 13:26.660
academic times or study hours or whatever

13:26.660 --> 13:30.560
um you so that they when they come here

13:30.560 --> 13:34.540
you know you know they can focus you know

13:34.540 --> 13:37.400
on on doing the things that they need to

13:37.400 --> 13:41.040
do instead of having to struggle so much i

13:41.040 --> 13:42.460
mean i think it's just like our parents

13:42.460 --> 13:44.020
you know they struggle so that we don't

13:44.020 --> 13:46.060
have to struggle and we don't i mean we

13:46.060 --> 13:48.420
don't struggle we're still struggling but

13:48.420 --> 13:50.020
at a different level You know what I mean?

13:50.360 --> 13:53.520
We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry,

13:53.660 --> 13:55.160
once we get out of here, we're not going

13:55.160 --> 13:56.760
to have to worry about where am I going to

13:56.760 --> 13:59.100
get something to eat like before or how

13:59.100 --> 14:00.460
are we going to pay the bills. We're

14:00.460 --> 14:01.980
probably going to have to, you know, we're

14:01.980 --> 14:03.400
probably going to be able to pay even our

14:03.400 --> 14:07.340
parents' bills. Hopefully, yeah. Yeah, I

14:07.340 --> 14:13.320
think it also goes

14:13.320 --> 14:15.900
back to the question about where, why did

14:15.900 --> 14:18.020
we choose a hunger strike. It's kind of

14:18.020 --> 14:20.180
like, you know, we know that our grades

14:20.180 --> 14:21.600
are going to suffer from this and we're

14:21.600 --> 14:24.100
not going to graduate with a great GPA,

14:24.280 --> 14:27.180
you know, as we could have. And I mean,

14:27.180 --> 14:29.800
it's to show that, I mean, we know that

14:29.800 --> 14:33.540
we're capable of doing a work, but we feel

14:33.540 --> 14:35.840
so strongly about this that we're willing

14:35.840 --> 14:38.740
to do a little bit, you know, worse than

14:38.740 --> 14:40.820
everybody else because our issues are so

14:40.820 --> 14:41.260
important.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.040
I don't know if the administration sees

14:47.040 --> 14:50.200
that, but I don't know if anybody sees

14:50.200 --> 14:56.680
that. I know that I could be a nice

14:56.680 --> 15:05.180
student, but I choose to better be a human

15:05.180 --> 15:08.280
being first, first and to care more about

15:08.280 --> 15:12.400
my people than about my grades. I was

15:12.400 --> 15:14.940
going to ask you, related to the incident

15:14.940 --> 15:17.800
that happened on Sunday at the Flix, the

15:17.800 --> 15:23.140
film, notaries of shows, how do you feel

15:23.140 --> 15:26.480
or what steps can the university take to

15:26.480 --> 15:30.140
educate the student community, even staff

15:30.140 --> 15:33.960
and faculty, about the issue of ongoing

15:33.960 --> 15:36.980
racism, the issue why it's important to

15:36.980 --> 15:40.100
have abandoned graves on this campus. How

15:40.100 --> 15:42.300
do you think the university can take a

15:42.300 --> 15:46.260
proactive role in educating the community?

15:46.640 --> 15:49.940
I think if they really truly believe that

15:49.940 --> 15:51.840
that isn't right, that the incident at

15:51.840 --> 15:54.260
Flix isn't right, or that people should

15:54.260 --> 15:58.500
know and should understand that the

15:58.500 --> 16:00.420
pesticides and the harm that they're doing

16:00.420 --> 16:02.760
to people is wrong, then they should take

16:02.760 --> 16:04.020
it upon themselves to educate this

16:04.020 --> 16:05.000
university. If they really feel

16:05.000 --> 16:06.400
responsible for the education of their

16:06.400 --> 16:08.480
students, if they really, if they believe

16:08.480 --> 16:09.840
that that is an important issue, that

16:09.840 --> 16:12.360
people's lives and people's health and the

16:12.360 --> 16:14.680
reaction of some or a lot of students

16:14.680 --> 16:18.460
finding that amusing, there's something

16:18.460 --> 16:19.640
wrong with that. There's something wrong

16:19.640 --> 16:22.000
with the mentality or with the ignorance

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
level or something of the students at this

16:24.000 --> 16:25.800
university. And they are responsible

16:25.800 --> 16:27.700
because they're the administrators,

16:27.800 --> 16:29.520
they're in charge of this school. They're

16:29.520 --> 16:32.620
here to serve the students, but they're

16:32.620 --> 16:34.580
also here to help educate them. And

16:34.580 --> 16:36.260
there's, I mean, to me that proved just a

16:36.260 --> 16:37.780
lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me,

16:37.820 --> 16:39.600
but it was very offensive and it was very

16:39.600 --> 16:41.660
disrespectful. And if they really, if they

16:41.660 --> 16:43.820
agree with that at all, then it's their

16:43.820 --> 16:46.920
responsibility to deal with it. I mean,

16:46.940 --> 16:49.720
the main things that we're, you know, just

16:49.720 --> 16:52.100
to bring up what we're striking striking

16:52.100 --> 16:57.500
about. We have these issues that we have

16:57.500 --> 16:59.420
been dealing with as a community for a

16:59.420 --> 17:05.360
long time. One of them being a campus ban

17:05.360 --> 17:09.980
on grapes, the development of a Chicano

17:09.980 --> 17:13.460
Studies program, and the community center

17:13.460 --> 17:14.220
in Hispalo Alto.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.640
These are things that we can talk about

17:19.640 --> 17:25.140
specifically and offered for Cecilia

17:25.140 --> 17:27.040
Bulciaga. And the offer for a high-level

17:27.040 --> 17:29.940
position for Cecilia Bulciaga, a high

17:29.940 --> 17:34.880
-level administrator here. Why is it

17:34.880 --> 17:38.180
important for the university to recognize

17:38.180 --> 17:44.380
Cecilia's contributions? Why is Cecilia's

17:44.380 --> 17:47.560
position in Cecilia's role included among

17:47.560 --> 17:52.180
these other three? Well basically because

17:52.180 --> 17:55.060
it ties down to the whole approach that

17:55.060 --> 17:56.880
we're taking that our education isn't

17:56.880 --> 17:58.940
addressing the real issues. You know the

17:58.940 --> 18:02.480
issues being poverty, the joblessness, and

18:02.480 --> 18:06.560
you know the over representation we have

18:06.560 --> 18:08.680
in the jails and just everything.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.220
anything. And she ties into that because

18:11.220 --> 18:14.660
Cecilia has always worked for those

18:14.660 --> 18:20.460
issues. She was working on the Boycott

18:20.460 --> 18:23.620
Grapes campaign. And when she gets here,

18:23.740 --> 18:30.080
you get here, she's like a role model.

18:39.300 --> 18:44.460
Oh, man, I'm getting tired. Oh, no, you're

18:44.460 --> 18:46.460
good. Yeah, what we're talking about,

18:46.520 --> 18:50.500
she's a role model and a role mother.

18:51.660 --> 18:55.560
Mother figure. Mother figure. That's it.

18:55.740 --> 18:58.900
No, I guess basically because she helps in

18:58.900 --> 19:02.420
just keeping us here because it's hard to

19:02.420 --> 19:04.800
survive in a campus like this when you

19:04.800 --> 19:06.880
have people like Sunday nights at Flick

19:06.880 --> 19:09.600
saying, beaners go home or, you know,

19:09.620 --> 19:11.880
saying stuff like that here at Stanford. I

19:11.880 --> 19:13.960
mean, how are we supposed to survive in a

19:13.960 --> 19:16.300
climate that doesn't even accept us, that

19:16.300 --> 19:18.260
you have to justify your existence? And

19:18.260 --> 19:20.840
you need people like Cecilia Bustiaga and

19:20.840 --> 19:24.720
like Francis that just help you out just

19:24.720 --> 19:27.000
to make, like, especially the transition

19:27.000 --> 19:29.200
from, like, your first year. I mean,

19:29.260 --> 19:31.220
that's what helped me so much living in

19:31.220 --> 19:33.400
Zapata my very first year is, Because I

19:33.400 --> 19:36.000
survived the whole year because I was

19:36.000 --> 19:39.580
living there, I think. She helped out a

19:39.580 --> 19:43.140
lot with my parents and just everything.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.140
They're always caring for you. She's an

19:47.140 --> 19:51.100
important contact for us. There's so few

19:51.100 --> 19:54.260
of us here. And then there's so few of our

19:54.260 --> 19:58.600
Chicano and Chicana role models here that

19:58.600 --> 20:01.600
we can talk to and say, hey, this happened

20:01.600 --> 20:04.920
to me today. Or, you know, I really, it's

20:04.920 --> 20:07.540
really strange for me to be here and not

20:07.540 --> 20:09.560
be back home where I see a lot of people

20:09.560 --> 20:11.980
who look like myself, you know. And these

20:11.980 --> 20:13.940
are people that you can talk to. Like

20:13.940 --> 20:16.780
Cecilia, you know, she's, she's, I mean, I

20:16.780 --> 20:19.640
find it incredible she always has time to

20:19.640 --> 20:24.440
hear us out. Always. Yeah, when, when I

20:24.440 --> 20:26.820
was a freshman, like I have a really nice

20:26.820 --> 20:31.340
story about her that, when when I, well I

20:31.340 --> 20:34.420
didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get

20:34.420 --> 20:36.740
to live in Zapata my freshman year. And

20:36.740 --> 20:39.780
so, so like I had a lot of problems like

20:39.780 --> 20:42.380
just trying to adapt and trying to, trying

20:42.380 --> 20:44.080
to decide like what I was going to do with

20:44.080 --> 20:46.020
my life. And I had this whole big problem

20:46.020 --> 20:48.100
about deciding whether to be a doctor and

20:48.100 --> 20:51.400
secure a good financial future for myself

20:51.400 --> 20:53.220
and for my family or do what I really

20:53.220 --> 20:54.980
wanted to do, which was to be a teacher.

20:55.400 --> 20:59.860
And my, my freshman advisor recommended

20:59.860 --> 21:02.100
that I go to her because he had heard so

21:02.100 --> 21:04.180
many nice things about her that he thought

21:04.180 --> 21:06.140
she could help me. And I remember going

21:06.140 --> 21:09.080
into her office and just like crying my

21:09.080 --> 21:11.040
guts out because I didn't know what, I

21:11.040 --> 21:12.480
didn't know where I fit into this

21:12.480 --> 21:15.840
university. And she talked, she had time,

21:15.900 --> 21:19.180
like she sat with me in her office and

21:19.180 --> 21:22.420
talked to me and encouraged me to do what

21:22.420 --> 21:25.900
I felt was right, you know, to let my

21:25.900 --> 21:30.140
heart decide And, I mean, for the

21:30.140 --> 21:32.860
university not to recognize that she is

21:32.860 --> 21:35.740
capable of keeping me here because I was

21:35.740 --> 21:39.880
ready to leave. And she literally helped

21:39.880 --> 21:43.580
me to stay. And if it wasn't for her, I

21:43.580 --> 21:47.700
mean, I wouldn't be here. All of you are

21:47.700 --> 21:49.740
members of METCHA, Movimiento Estudante de

21:49.740 --> 21:53.540
Chicano. That's long history. What is the

21:53.540 --> 21:57.040
significance of this new phase? And I'm

21:57.040 --> 22:00.020
referring specifically to the various

22:00.020 --> 22:04.140
events that started at UCLA, UC Santa

22:04.140 --> 22:06.540
Barbara, Colorado, University of Colorado,

22:06.800 --> 22:08.860
and Michigan State. Virginia, too.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.760
Virginia, too. Can you talk about this in

22:11.760 --> 22:14.880
the context of the overall resurgence of

22:14.880 --> 22:19.100
MECHA and Chicano student activism? I

22:19.100 --> 22:22.320
think as Mecha is the Chicano student

22:22.320 --> 22:24.880
movement and there's a long history of

22:24.880 --> 22:27.060
activism there, leading back to the

22:27.060 --> 22:29.540
original plan of Plan de Santa Aurora. And

22:29.540 --> 22:33.000
I think that each of us has maintained

22:33.000 --> 22:38.360
that goal of the betterment of la raza.

22:39.460 --> 22:44.480
Our Mecha is very strong and we support

22:44.480 --> 22:49.540
with those founding Mechistas, came up

22:49.540 --> 22:51.220
with in terms of the plan of Santa

22:51.220 --> 22:56.260
Barbara. It's gaining, it's in UCLA and UC

22:56.260 --> 22:58.280
Santa Barbara and other universities,

22:58.540 --> 23:02.660
Mecha members and and other organizations

23:02.660 --> 23:06.480
are taking the leadership and moving the

23:06.480 --> 23:10.400
universities to meet the demands. The

23:10.400 --> 23:11.560
thing is playing instruments to roll.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.380
They got misquoted? Are they in support?

23:19.800 --> 23:25.460
Yeah. So what happened? That sucks man. I

23:25.460 --> 23:28.480
feel bad for lying about it. Oh yeah,

23:28.620 --> 23:32.140
sorry. Sorry. I was going to ask you, I

23:32.140 --> 23:37.080
know earlier I talked to your dad, and I

23:37.080 --> 23:40.000
talked to your mom, and I know from them

23:40.000 --> 23:42.640
that it's been really hard for them. I

23:42.640 --> 23:44.380
mean, they haven't been eating as well.

23:44.920 --> 23:48.140
They're also, in a way, also in the hunger

23:48.140 --> 23:51.480
strike. How do you feel about your

23:51.480 --> 23:55.660
parents' role in this? How are you going

23:55.660 --> 23:57.160
to explain it to your parents once it's

23:57.160 --> 23:58.800
over and you haven't really explained it

23:58.800 --> 23:59.020
yet?

24:03.480 --> 24:07.860
Well, I told my biggest worry in terms of

24:07.860 --> 24:10.660
deciding to take part in the fast was how

24:10.660 --> 24:13.040
my mom was going to take it. Because I

24:13.040 --> 24:14.700
thought she was going to, you know, she's

24:14.700 --> 24:15.840
an asthmatic and I thought she was going

24:15.840 --> 24:17.340
to get sick because any time she stresses

24:17.340 --> 24:19.340
out she has really bad attacks and stuff.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.280
I just knew I was going to worry her and I

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
was going to hurt her and that was the

24:23.280 --> 24:25.260
thing that scared me the most. But I

24:25.260 --> 24:27.780
talked to her about it and I kind of eased

24:27.780 --> 24:28.760
her into it. But I started telling her

24:28.760 --> 24:30.840
first about the plan to stay out of the

24:30.840 --> 24:31.880
quarter and stuff like that. And she was

24:31.880 --> 24:34.760
like, well, she told me before I even

24:34.760 --> 24:35.980
mentioned to her that I was going to fast.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.600
She said, well, Mija, when you are

24:37.600 --> 24:39.440
leading, when you are a leader and you

24:39.440 --> 24:41.420
want to take part in changing things when

24:41.420 --> 24:42.760
they're bad, sometimes you have to make

24:42.760 --> 24:45.060
sacrifices. She said, and you know,

24:45.080 --> 24:47.260
whatever happens, you guys, you know, you

24:47.260 --> 24:48.540
have my prayers and you have my support.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.180
And so then when I told her, she was like,

24:50.240 --> 24:52.460
oh, and I guess she maybe understood or

24:52.460 --> 24:53.840
was getting, you know, thought that I was

24:53.840 --> 24:55.560
going to get to that because I told her

24:55.560 --> 24:56.800
and she She was like, well, she said, I'm

24:56.800 --> 24:58.060
not going to tell you to do it, and I'm

24:58.060 --> 24:59.020
not going to tell you not to do it,

24:59.040 --> 25:01.500
because I don't want to feel responsible

25:01.500 --> 25:02.740
for you doing it, and I don't want to feel

25:02.740 --> 25:05.100
responsible for you feeling bad because

25:05.100 --> 25:07.480
maybe it didn't succeed or because you

25:07.480 --> 25:09.540
really didn't want to do what you wanted

25:09.540 --> 25:11.300
to. She said, but I'm really scared. But

25:11.300 --> 25:15.280
she said that she had faith in God, and as

25:15.280 --> 25:16.460
long as I had faith in God, that

25:16.460 --> 25:18.280
everything was going to be okay. And so

25:18.280 --> 25:19.840
for me, it was very empowering, because

25:19.840 --> 25:21.680
the minute I got off the phone, I decided,

25:21.680 --> 25:24.160
I decided, I really felt strongly about it

25:24.160 --> 25:25.940
already and I decided that this was

25:25.940 --> 25:27.080
something I was going to do. And even

25:27.080 --> 25:28.320
though I was going to cause her a lot of

25:28.320 --> 25:31.020
pain, that I was going to get through it

25:31.020 --> 25:32.020
and she was going to get through it. And

25:32.020 --> 25:34.380
I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been

25:34.380 --> 25:36.220
eating either. And I haven't been able to

25:36.220 --> 25:38.220
speak with her since that last time I

25:38.220 --> 25:42.340
talked to her. But like she told me, she

25:42.340 --> 25:45.320
said, you know, she said for herself that

25:45.320 --> 25:47.360
she's already past her youth and she

25:47.360 --> 25:48.740
doesn't know that she can do that much

25:48.740 --> 25:50.760
anymore. And she said, it's our turn. And

25:50.760 --> 25:53.280
so here we are, we're trying to make

25:53.280 --> 25:55.280
changes because I don't want to, I really

25:55.280 --> 25:56.760
don't want my little brother to have to do

25:56.760 --> 25:59.240
something like this. And I have a younger

25:59.240 --> 26:00.900
sister who's here also and I don't want

26:00.900 --> 26:03.000
her to have to, you know, continue this. I

26:03.000 --> 26:04.320
mean, she probably won't have to just

26:04.320 --> 26:06.100
because that's the way things are around

26:06.100 --> 26:09.360
here. But, you know, if I can help out in

26:09.360 --> 26:11.480
some way so that, you know, the kids that

26:11.480 --> 26:12.980
come here later don't have to be going

26:12.980 --> 26:14.600
through this, then that would be awesome.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.300
So, yeah.

26:23.260 --> 26:27.160
I guess that was the hardest thing for me

26:27.160 --> 26:31.440
as well. I knew when we thought of the

26:31.440 --> 26:34.540
idea, I knew that I wanted to do it. I

26:34.540 --> 26:37.140
wanted to be part of the hunger strike. I

26:37.140 --> 26:40.200
just knew that I could do it and I was

26:40.200 --> 26:43.120
going to have the willpower to go through

26:43.120 --> 26:45.120
with it. it, but the only thing was my

26:45.120 --> 26:47.040
mom. I didn't know how to tell her. I

26:47.040 --> 26:49.240
didn't know what to tell her. I was scared

26:49.240 --> 26:51.000
because I know that the way my mom is, she

26:51.000 --> 26:54.420
worries and she doesn't sleep at night and

26:54.420 --> 26:59.360
she can't eat. It's just bad. I hate it. I

26:59.360 --> 27:02.320
don't like doing that to her because she

27:02.320 --> 27:05.020
still works and she's getting older and

27:05.020 --> 27:08.100
everything. I don't know. It's just

27:08.100 --> 27:10.180
something I felt so deep from my heart. I

27:10.180 --> 27:11.820
just thought, you know, so many people are

27:11.820 --> 27:13.700
are going to gain a lot from this. So many

27:13.700 --> 27:17.260
people are going to have a lot of things

27:17.260 --> 27:19.280
come out of this, especially with the Ispa

27:19.280 --> 27:21.900
Lo Alto Community Center and with the

27:21.900 --> 27:25.360
boycott on the graves. It's just immediate

27:25.360 --> 27:30.220
help for people that are dying and being

27:30.220 --> 27:34.360
born with birth defects. So when I told

27:34.360 --> 27:38.680
her, she was telling me she didn't want me

27:38.680 --> 27:40.560
to do it. She was telling me I'm anemic,

27:40.760 --> 27:42.900
that I was anemic. Then my dad told me I

27:42.900 --> 27:45.320
had a low red blood cell count. They were

27:45.320 --> 27:46.920
just coming up with all these things that

27:46.920 --> 27:49.000
I had that I shouldn't be doing it because

27:49.000 --> 27:50.860
I was so skinny and I was going to

27:50.860 --> 27:54.660
disappear and this and that. So then, oh,

27:54.660 --> 27:59.020
sorry. So then after,

28:01.240 --> 28:02.960
oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really

28:02.960 --> 28:05.840
hard. She was crying and everything. And

28:05.840 --> 28:08.080
then I called her after the first day of

28:08.080 --> 28:11.020
the hunger strike, like, and she couldn't

28:11.020 --> 28:12.940
talk to me because she didn't want to cry

28:12.940 --> 28:15.980
on the phone. So that just made me, I was

28:15.980 --> 28:17.380
just crying. I was talking to my sister

28:17.380 --> 28:19.040
and my sister was, you know, I was telling

28:19.040 --> 28:20.960
her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry. Tell

28:20.960 --> 28:22.680
her that I'm feeling good, the issues are

28:22.680 --> 28:24.260
keeping me alive and they're going to keep

28:24.260 --> 28:27.320
me alive and I'm going to be okay. So, but

28:27.320 --> 28:28.900
she's going to come today because she's

28:28.900 --> 28:31.120
worried and she wants to see me.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.500
Well, the hardest part of this whole thing

28:37.500 --> 28:42.040
was just to tell my mom and dad that I was

28:42.040 --> 28:44.560
going to do this because we've all said we

28:44.560 --> 28:49.240
don't want to make them suffer. But I told

28:49.240 --> 28:51.700
her and she said, okay, well if you guys

28:51.700 --> 28:53.080
are still out there after three days then

28:53.080 --> 28:55.560
I'm going to come out. out. And then right

28:55.560 --> 28:58.500
like a few minutes before I left I was

28:58.500 --> 29:00.660
talking to her, y me estaba dando la

29:00.660 --> 29:02.700
bendicion. Do I have to translate that?

29:03.000 --> 29:08.540
Oh, okay. And then, um, and then, um, so,

29:08.680 --> 29:11.500
you know, she was crying and I could tell

29:11.500 --> 29:13.500
and she was giving me the bendicion. And

29:13.500 --> 29:15.040
so she was like, you know what, I'm going

29:15.040 --> 29:17.240
to be out there tomorrow and stuff. And,

29:17.320 --> 29:19.460
you know, my mom and dad got some money

29:19.460 --> 29:22.020
together and then so my mom could fly out

29:22.020 --> 29:25.760
here and and stuff. And so she came out

29:25.760 --> 29:28.480
last night and I mean I think it was

29:28.480 --> 29:30.640
better for her to come because she was

29:30.640 --> 29:32.220
upset when she saw me and she was crying

29:32.220 --> 29:34.520
and stuff but she's been really good and

29:34.520 --> 29:36.000
everybody's been really supportive of her

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
and she's been, I think it makes her feel

29:38.000 --> 29:41.320
good to feel useful to this thing. She

29:41.320 --> 29:45.120
feels a part of this strike and she feels

29:45.120 --> 29:47.060
a part of the movement and I think that

29:47.060 --> 29:50.180
she is because we're fighting for her and

29:50.180 --> 29:53.280
for for everybody. She slept out there

29:53.280 --> 30:00.420
with us last night. She's hardcore. For

30:00.420 --> 30:02.960
me, that was definitely the hardest part.

30:03.660 --> 30:07.120
After I did it, I wished that I didn't

30:07.120 --> 30:12.160
have to, but I know that if I hadn't, it

30:12.160 --> 30:13.780
would have been worse for her if she had

30:13.780 --> 30:17.980
found out some other way. I'm just really

30:17.980 --> 30:19.420
worried about her because she has heart

30:19.420 --> 30:22.860
problems. I was afraid that if she saw me

30:22.860 --> 30:26.020
on the news or something, you know, , you

30:26.020 --> 30:29.260
know, we'd end up everything with yours.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.680
But, you know, she's fine and she already

30:32.680 --> 30:35.260
told me that she supports me. And even

30:35.260 --> 30:37.420
though it's the hardest thing, you know,

30:37.460 --> 30:40.540
for her, like, she knows. So I told her

30:40.540 --> 30:42.560
that it was her who taught me how to fight

30:42.560 --> 30:46.200
and maybe that, hopefully that made her

30:46.200 --> 30:48.300
feel a little bit better but maybe,

30:48.480 --> 30:50.860
hopefully, I don't know. I don't know

30:50.860 --> 30:53.620
exactly how she is. Last time I talked to

30:53.620 --> 30:57.520
her she sounded very weak and my dad

30:57.520 --> 30:59.360
called me like the next morning, the

30:59.360 --> 31:02.340
morning after I told my mom and he tried

31:02.340 --> 31:04.440
his hardest to convince me not to do it.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.980
He told me all kinds of things. And he

31:06.980 --> 31:09.040
told me, why do you want to go through

31:09.040 --> 31:11.460
another hunger after you've suffered so

31:11.460 --> 31:13.900
many hungers in your life? And just

31:13.900 --> 31:15.420
reminding me of all the things that I've

31:15.420 --> 31:17.060
had to go through just to get where I am

31:17.060 --> 31:20.300
and trying to tell me, well, don't do it.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.280
But I still did it, and he's here right

31:23.280 --> 31:26.200
now, and he came and told me. He's still

31:26.200 --> 31:27.960
trying to convince me to stop because he

31:27.960 --> 31:30.240
goes, he says, you know, your mom's going

31:30.240 --> 31:33.060
to come up here tomorrow, and if you're

31:33.060 --> 31:34.620
still on the strike, she's going to strike

31:34.620 --> 31:40.180
with you. I think generally my parents

31:40.180 --> 31:42.380
have the same feelings as all the others

31:42.380 --> 31:45.600
do, but it's a little bit easier for them

31:45.600 --> 31:46.940
to handle because tonight's going to be my

31:46.940 --> 31:50.180
last day fasting. So that's basically it.

31:51.580 --> 31:56.660
Last word, Yvonne? Well, okay. You said

31:56.660 --> 31:58.840
it's for historical purposes, right? So

31:58.840 --> 32:02.980
when, you know, 20 years from now when

32:02.980 --> 32:04.480
other Chicanos look at this, you know,

32:04.520 --> 32:07.880
we... And Chicanas. And Chicanas. Sorry,

32:08.140 --> 32:12.080
I'm tired. You know, when other gente see

32:12.080 --> 32:15.960
this, just to remember that, you know,

32:15.960 --> 32:18.120
even when you're looking at this now, 20

32:18.120 --> 32:20.120
years later, the movement is still alive

32:20.120 --> 32:22.440
in you. And we still have to keep

32:22.440 --> 32:24.560
struggling because, you know... Well,

32:24.620 --> 32:26.560
hopefully we can stop. Hopefully we can

32:26.560 --> 32:28.120
stop some of it, but I mean if it's still

32:28.120 --> 32:33.340
it's still bad, you know now You know we

32:33.340 --> 32:35.600
can do it. Yeah, and don't take advantage

32:36.480 --> 32:39.380
of what You know what you have I guess

32:39.380 --> 32:41.860
like like for us is very important to say

32:41.860 --> 32:44.500
Oh, we have we have a sento and there's a

32:44.500 --> 32:46.100
lot of people that work hard for it Settle

32:46.100 --> 32:47.760
for what you don't settle for you have and

32:47.760 --> 32:49.760
don't forget us pretty much Don't forget

32:49.760 --> 32:51.980
the people who fought before you all the

32:51.980 --> 32:53.600
things like the people that fought before

32:53.600 --> 32:58.660
us and before us and before them and just

32:58.660 --> 33:02.020
remember we're doing this for you for the

33:02.020 --> 33:04.660
future. For the youth!

33:08.180 --> 33:13.760
My name is Sh... Oh, okay. The new message

33:13.760 --> 33:13.920
is this...

33:40.680 --> 33:43.900
It is currently about 7.30 on the 6th of

33:43.900 --> 33:49.700
May, Friday, 1994. We have just collected,

33:50.000 --> 33:55.280
witnessed the five testimonials from five

33:55.280 --> 33:57.280
of the hunger strikers, which have

33:57.280 --> 34:02.680
included at one point over 100 solidarity

34:02.680 --> 34:07.080
strikers. At this time, we've received the

34:07.080 --> 34:08.460
latest response from the Administration,

34:08.860 --> 34:10.780
which has been recalcitrant up to this

34:10.780 --> 34:13.800
point. and I understand that there's still

34:13.800 --> 34:16.160
many points that need to be go need to be

34:16.160 --> 34:18.960
reviewed and some more dialogue that needs

34:18.960 --> 34:20.780
to be that needs to take place but at the

34:20.780 --> 34:23.800
moment it looks as though statement that

34:23.800 --> 34:26.720
that we have made as a community the

34:26.720 --> 34:28.720
Chicano community and the statement that

34:28.720 --> 34:31.660
comes from various communities throughout

34:31.660 --> 34:34.080
the Bay Area and the nation and solidarity

34:34.080 --> 34:39.440
with us has has begun to open the

34:39.440 --> 34:41.340
administration's eyes to the justness of

34:41.340 --> 34:45.480
our cause and our demands. However, as I

34:45.480 --> 34:48.380
said, there still is some work to be done.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.740
For the moment, it seems as though our

34:52.740 --> 34:56.260
first demand, that is the offering of a

34:56.260 --> 34:58.320
high-level position to Associate Dean

34:58.320 --> 35:00.860
Cecilia Bursiaga, is still not being met.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.540
And as I said, this is our first demand

35:04.540 --> 35:08.280
and it's very important to us. So more

35:08.280 --> 35:11.260
negotiation has to go on with regards to

35:11.260 --> 35:14.220
that. The second demand involves the

35:14.220 --> 35:15.800
establishment of a community center in

35:15.800 --> 35:18.880
East Palo Alto to serve the community that

35:18.880 --> 35:21.880
literally works to preserve the

35:21.880 --> 35:28.000
functioning of this university. And as far

35:28.000 --> 35:34.180
as the administration is concerned, they

35:34.180 --> 35:37.260
are receptive to the initiative that the

35:37.260 --> 35:38.700
Chicano students, the Chicano and Chicana

35:38.700 --> 35:41.040
students have presented in terms of

35:41.040 --> 35:43.700
bridging the gap between the community and

35:43.700 --> 35:47.220
the academy. This has been a very

35:47.220 --> 35:50.160
important component to the struggle here.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.620
As a matter of fact, this is a component

35:52.620 --> 35:54.600
that isn't new. It goes all the way back

35:54.600 --> 35:56.560
to the Plan de Santa Barbara, which

35:56.560 --> 36:03.120
inaugurated Mecha. So we are very hopeful

36:03.120 --> 36:05.140
that some breakthrough will come through

36:05.140 --> 36:06.740
here. As regards to the Chicano and

36:06.740 --> 36:10.740
Chicana studies, again, this is the

36:10.740 --> 36:13.540
justness and the feasibility of this

36:13.540 --> 36:16.540
demand has led the administration to also

36:16.540 --> 36:21.020
give overtures that are encouraging.

36:21.020 --> 36:26.080
Finally, the issue of grapes on campus

36:26.080 --> 36:29.240
has, and specifically the negative

36:29.240 --> 36:31.960
reactions, the racist reactions to our

36:31.960 --> 36:33.820
efforts to educate the community at

36:33.820 --> 36:38.220
Stanford has, and our protest, our protest

36:38.220 --> 36:41.660
against those negative reactions has led

36:41.660 --> 36:43.680
the university to embark upon an

36:43.680 --> 36:47.060
initiative to educate all the dorms

36:47.060 --> 36:48.560
through the showing of the no grapes video

36:48.560 --> 36:55.420
and also through establishing a dialogue

36:55.420 --> 36:57.040
with our community, the Chicano community,

36:57.740 --> 37:00.500
in an effort to bridge the gaps that have

37:00.500 --> 37:03.780
been caused,

37:04.020 --> 37:06.840
bridge the divisions that have been caused

37:06.840 --> 37:11.180
by the racism that's very often a result

37:11.180 --> 37:15.920
of an academy which is very hierarchical

37:15.920 --> 37:19.160
and one which is institutionally and

37:19.160 --> 37:21.500
structurally hostile to the presence of

37:21.500 --> 37:24.240
minorities and other marginalized people.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.320
With this, I would just like to say, Que

37:27.320 --> 37:30.500
viva la raza y adelante. We're going to

37:30.500 --> 37:30.980
win this one.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.900
Thank you. Thank you.
