00:15.700 --> 00:19.440
That is Roscoe. Here is the news read by

00:19.440 --> 00:22.600
Sergei Horny. Thanks for the headline. In

00:22.600 --> 00:24.620
Geneva, the Italian delegate has supported

00:24.620 --> 00:27.060
the Soviet proposal on the Laos question.

00:27.060 --> 00:31.440
In Van Zandt, Laos, the population held an

00:31.440 --> 00:34.900
anti-American demonstration. Once again

00:34.900 --> 00:37.700
racial outbursts are about to flare up in

00:37.700 --> 00:41.480
Montgomery, Alabama. Cuba will strive to

00:41.480 --> 00:44.260
win back Guantanamo Bay peacefully. April

00:44.260 --> 00:47.640
Castro. Nikita Khrushchev met Prime

00:47.640 --> 00:50.820
Minister Ali Sadmak of Somalia in Moscow

00:50.820 --> 00:53.480
today. The Somali leader has come to the

00:53.480 --> 00:56.820
USSR on an official spokesperson. Those

00:56.820 --> 00:58.680
are the headlines. They're now part of the

00:58.680 --> 01:01.420
session. At the international conference

01:01.420 --> 01:04.200
for a Laotian settlement, the Chinese

01:04.200 --> 01:06.820
foreign minister Chen Yin announced the

01:06.820 --> 01:08.620
Laotian people's striving for independence

01:08.620 --> 01:10.760
and insanity proclaimed by the

01:10.760 --> 01:12.320
representatives of the royal government

01:12.320 --> 01:16.420
and the Patek Laos. The Chinese minister

01:16.420 --> 01:20.080
also upheld the Soviet proposal. At the

01:20.080 --> 01:22.340
same time, he turned down the American

01:22.340 --> 01:24.700
proposals as being incompatible with the

01:24.700 --> 01:29.160
Canadian of 1954, and favor T.D.A. as

01:29.160 --> 01:30.960
placing Laos under an international

01:30.960 --> 01:35.540
condominium. Chen Xi emphasized that in no

01:35.540 --> 01:37.700
case could interference in Laos' domestic

01:37.700 --> 01:41.040
affairs be tolerated. The Chinese foreign

01:41.040 --> 01:43.000
minister also affirmed the international

01:43.000 --> 01:45.440
organs proposed by the Americans to

01:45.440 --> 01:48.240
control the foreign aid received by Laos

01:48.240 --> 01:50.500
as being incompatible with Laos'

01:50.540 --> 01:54.040
sovereignty. You are bound to say that

01:54.040 --> 01:56.420
peace and security could not be ensured in

01:56.420 --> 01:59.100
Asia until the United States stopped its

01:59.100 --> 02:00.580
policy of interference and aggression

02:00.580 --> 02:03.540
against the countries of Asia. The threat

02:03.540 --> 02:05.260
to the peace and security in Southeast

02:05.260 --> 02:08.300
Asia, including Laos, stems from the

02:08.300 --> 02:09.960
policy of aggression and interference

02:09.960 --> 02:12.660
pursued by the United States and the CETA

02:12.660 --> 02:16.260
war bloc. Cheney expressed the point that

02:16.260 --> 02:18.560
peace and security in Southeast Asia could

02:18.560 --> 02:21.160
only be guaranteed when the United States

02:21.160 --> 02:23.940
stops its aggression and its efforts, and

02:23.940 --> 02:26.180
when a peace area is formed in Southeast

02:26.180 --> 02:29.080
Asia in place of the CTO military bloc.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.300
The Chinese delegate further pointed out

02:32.300 --> 02:34.480
that the two proposals put forward by the

02:34.480 --> 02:37.300
Soviet Union for a Laotian settlement stem

02:37.300 --> 02:39.100
from principles as we've expressed for

02:39.100 --> 02:41.560
years as independence and sovereignty, and

02:41.560 --> 02:43.360
dovetail with the Geneva agreements of

02:43.360 --> 02:48.040
1954. The Chinese delegation believes that

02:48.040 --> 02:50.460
the Soviet report should serve as a basis

02:50.460 --> 02:53.060
for discussion with the government and as

02:53.060 --> 02:56.400
a basis for agreement. Chen added that

02:56.400 --> 02:58.780
other delegations had also made proposals

02:58.780 --> 03:02.460
for a Lao-Chi settlement. We are prepared,

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
he said, in the course of discussion and

03:04.700 --> 03:07.240
consultations, to thoroughly study and

03:07.240 --> 03:09.660
consider all that is constructed in these

03:09.660 --> 03:12.680
proposals. The next to speak was the

03:12.680 --> 03:15.100
Foreign Minister of Thailand, Thanat

03:15.100 --> 03:17.900
Ketne. In violation of the agreement

03:17.900 --> 03:20.600
reached on who is to represent laws at the

03:20.600 --> 03:22.560
conference, he proposed that

03:22.560 --> 03:24.460
representatives of all Russian political

03:24.460 --> 03:26.480
parties be included in the number of

03:26.480 --> 03:29.720
negotiators. The chairman, Georgi Pushkin,

03:29.820 --> 03:33.020
of the USSR, explained the situation to

03:33.020 --> 03:35.300
the Thailand representative. The former

03:35.300 --> 03:37.760
Thailand foreign minister had been linked

03:37.760 --> 03:40.540
to the opening of the conference and was

03:40.540 --> 03:42.540
unaware that these points had been cleared

03:42.540 --> 03:44.960
up prior to the opening of the talks.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.600
Georgi Puskin further announced that at

03:48.600 --> 03:50.420
the request of a number of delegations,

03:50.440 --> 03:53.180
the conference would adjourn for two to

03:53.180 --> 03:55.800
three days to enable the delegates to

03:55.800 --> 03:58.500
examine the proposals and perhaps prepare

03:58.500 --> 04:01.240
their own. The next meeting will be called

04:01.240 --> 04:06.020
no later than on Monday, he said. In Vang

04:06.020 --> 04:08.300
Vieng, Laos, meanwhile, the population

04:08.300 --> 04:11.060
held a meeting and demonstration in

04:11.060 --> 04:13.500
protest against American imperialism by

04:13.500 --> 04:16.080
the Samarnakheti, who are trying to

04:16.080 --> 04:18.420
torpedo the conference in Geneva and the

04:18.420 --> 04:21.380
park in Namon. The head of the royal

04:21.380 --> 04:23.660
government's delegation at the Namon Park

04:23.660 --> 04:26.440
described a policy of genuine peace and

04:26.440 --> 04:28.600
neutrality to the end of the political

04:28.600 --> 04:31.500
program of the oil government. The head of

04:31.500 --> 04:34.120
the Pataslao delegation at the talk urged

04:34.120 --> 04:36.620
all Laotians to rally around the

04:36.620 --> 04:38.520
legitimate government headed by Prince

04:38.520 --> 04:40.920
Sivanapuma, who to support his political

04:40.920 --> 04:43.720
program had to work energetically for a

04:43.720 --> 04:48.900
generally peaceful and neutral world. The

04:48.900 --> 04:51.020
Democratic Republic of Vietnam is being

04:51.020 --> 04:53.020
swept by a wave of protest demonstrations

04:53.460 --> 04:55.160
against the aggressor actions of the

04:55.160 --> 04:58.220
United States and South Vietnam. Dozens of

04:58.220 --> 05:00.100
petitions from public organizations and

05:00.100 --> 05:02.520
political parties demanding a stop to

05:02.520 --> 05:04.180
American aggressive action on behalf of

05:04.180 --> 05:06.720
Vietnam have been sent to the co-chairs of

05:06.720 --> 05:08.500
the Geneva Conference and to the

05:08.500 --> 05:10.120
International Inspection and Control

05:10.120 --> 05:14.220
Commission in Vietnam. American factors,

05:14.460 --> 05:16.880
members of the Lincoln-Rockwell Nazi

05:16.880 --> 05:19.400
Organization, have arrived in Montgomery,

05:19.700 --> 05:22.520
Alabama to help the local Ku Klux Klan

05:22.520 --> 05:25.740
members. The Brown Theater's Sponsor

05:25.740 --> 05:28.780
Command Enforcement has declared that they

05:28.780 --> 05:31.000
will wipe out the participants of the

05:31.000 --> 05:35.780
Freedom Line. Judging from all this, blood

05:35.780 --> 05:38.140
will be spilled in Montgomery once again.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.220
Martin Sleety King, leader of the Fox

05:43.220 --> 05:45.380
News, a community progress of the colored

05:45.380 --> 05:47.400
people, told a press conference in

05:47.400 --> 05:49.560
Montgomery West today that the opponents

05:49.560 --> 05:52.040
of racial discrimination were before to

05:52.040 --> 05:55.200
continue the Freedom Riders. The New Gray

05:55.200 --> 05:57.080
leaders said that despite all the racial

05:57.080 --> 05:59.320
lawlessness, threats, and brute force

05:59.320 --> 06:01.600
confronting the Freedom Riders, they would

06:01.600 --> 06:04.560
not stop what they had spoken. Mr. King

06:04.560 --> 06:06.880
said that another eight racial segregation

06:06.880 --> 06:09.420
opponents had arrived in Montgomery from

06:09.420 --> 06:12.000
Nashville, Tennessee, to join the Freedom

06:12.000 --> 06:16.340
Riders. The American press, as well as the

06:16.340 --> 06:18.280
world, said, has been extensively

06:18.280 --> 06:20.080
commenting the racial outbursts in

06:20.080 --> 06:22.240
Alabama. For example, the Washington Post

06:22.240 --> 06:24.600
and Times-Herald wrote that there was not

06:24.600 --> 06:26.740
a shadow of a doubt that the cruelty and

06:26.740 --> 06:29.080
beatings in Alabama were getting headline

06:29.080 --> 06:31.960
stories in many world papers. The

06:31.960 --> 06:34.120
Washington paper wrote that there was no

06:34.120 --> 06:35.960
way of estimating the damage done to

06:35.960 --> 06:37.960
America's prestige by the racial riots.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.740
The British Yorkshire Post spitefully

06:40.740 --> 06:43.120
commented that the racial slurs in America

06:43.120 --> 06:45.060
would hardly help the American president

06:45.060 --> 06:47.100
to convince the media media and

06:47.100 --> 06:49.180
underdeveloped countries that the United

06:49.180 --> 06:51.760
States was carrying a torch showing them

06:51.760 --> 06:54.840
the way to freedom and democracy. CotÃ£o

06:54.840 --> 06:57.520
Osocava, a radio personal commentator,

06:57.540 --> 06:59.440
characteristically remarked that the New

06:59.440 --> 07:01.800
Hope question was a dirty spot in the

07:01.800 --> 07:05.600
history of the United States. Speaking at

07:05.600 --> 07:08.340
a meeting in Santiago, Cuba, Defense

07:08.340 --> 07:11.320
Minister Raul Castro declared that the

07:11.320 --> 07:14.440
American naval base of Guantanamo was a

07:14.440 --> 07:16.720
constant hotbed of provocation against

07:16.720 --> 07:21.540
Cuba. American planes, says Al Costo, have

07:21.540 --> 07:24.500
recently violated Cuban airspace 259

07:24.500 --> 07:27.880
times. They made provocative flights over

07:27.880 --> 07:30.600
Cuban territory and photographed it. In

07:30.600 --> 07:32.840
conclusion, the Cuban minister said that

07:32.840 --> 07:34.800
the Republic of Cuba would spare no effort

07:34.800 --> 07:36.980
to liquidating that American base in Cuba

07:36.980 --> 07:41.700
through peaceful raids. In New York, our

07:41.700 --> 07:43.540
Radio Moscow correspondent sent us the

07:43.540 --> 07:45.900
following dispatch. The failure of the

07:45.900 --> 07:48.400
Cuban invasion has intensified the clash

07:48.400 --> 07:50.420
between individual groups of the Cuban

07:50.420 --> 07:51.860
counter-revolutionaries in the United

07:51.860 --> 07:55.080
States. For example, the Emanuela Reyes

07:55.080 --> 07:57.900
group asked for it from the so-called

07:57.900 --> 08:00.680
Revolutionary Council Uniting Reactionary

08:00.680 --> 08:03.260
Emigrants. A person of that group said

08:03.260 --> 08:05.000
that with a blessing from the Central

08:05.000 --> 08:07.880
Intelligence Agency, the Revolutionary

08:07.880 --> 08:10.140
Council so called, was enlisting

08:10.140 --> 08:13.040
supporters of ex-dictator Batista for a

08:13.040 --> 08:15.980
new mercenary army without supporting the

08:15.980 --> 08:18.860
rare group. The New York Times reports

08:18.860 --> 08:21.180
that the rare group had received

08:21.180 --> 08:23.760
information from its agents in Cuba that

08:23.760 --> 08:25.960
underground activity there was almost

08:25.960 --> 08:28.080
impossible since there was not a single

08:28.080 --> 08:28.460
house

08:31.200 --> 08:34.100
The Afro-Asian delegation at the United

08:34.100 --> 08:36.020
Nations has come to the conclusion that

08:36.020 --> 08:38.840
the situation in Portuguese Angola could

08:38.840 --> 08:41.720
be discussed by the Security Council. The

08:41.720 --> 08:43.860
French news agency says that they may call

08:43.860 --> 08:45.840
for a meeting of the Security Council in

08:45.840 --> 08:48.460
the near future. The Prime Minister of

08:48.460 --> 08:51.540
Somalia, Abdirahid Ali Canemar, has

08:51.540 --> 08:54.920
arrived in Moscow on an official visit. He

08:54.920 --> 08:56.700
was led to the airfield by members of the

08:56.700 --> 08:58.580
civil service headed by the chairman of

08:58.580 --> 08:59.880
the council of ministries Nikita

08:59.880 --> 09:02.340
Khrushchev and other officials. The

09:02.340 --> 09:04.080
diplomatic corps were also at the

09:04.080 --> 09:06.180
airfield. A big crowd thwarted the

09:06.180 --> 09:08.620
statement made by the two prime ministers.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.480
Nikita Khrushchev said that the civil

09:12.480 --> 09:14.220
service people follow in great sympathy

09:14.220 --> 09:16.460
the efforts made by the Somali and other

09:16.460 --> 09:18.500
peoples of Africa who have rid themselves

09:18.500 --> 09:21.080
of the fetters of of colonialism and who

09:21.080 --> 09:23.260
are now trying to liquidate the burdensome

09:23.260 --> 09:25.500
heritage of the past and to further

09:25.500 --> 09:28.820
strengthen their national independence. We

09:28.820 --> 09:30.840
wish them all success in this, added

09:30.840 --> 09:33.480
Nikita Pujan. He also noted the

09:33.480 --> 09:36.100
satisfaction of wonderful views of the

09:36.100 --> 09:38.580
Somali and Soviet governments on a number

09:38.580 --> 09:41.360
of major international issues that came to

09:41.360 --> 09:43.860
light during the recent negotiations and

09:43.860 --> 09:46.020
from the exchanges of opinions between the

09:46.020 --> 09:48.600
Soviet goodwill missions and the Somali

09:48.600 --> 09:51.220
government. We are satisfied, he went on,

09:51.360 --> 09:53.300
that friendly relations have been

09:53.300 --> 09:55.420
established and are successfully

09:55.420 --> 09:58.020
developing between the Soviet Union and

09:58.020 --> 10:00.600
the Somali Republic, relations founded on

10:00.600 --> 10:02.960
principles of mutual respect and non

10:02.960 --> 10:04.360
-interference in the best of the terms.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.000
Nikita Khrushchev stressed the point that

10:08.000 --> 10:10.160
there are broad possibilities for a

10:10.160 --> 10:12.060
further spiritual development of serious

10:12.060 --> 10:14.540
Somali relations. For successful economic

10:14.540 --> 10:17.200
cooperation between the two countries and

10:17.200 --> 10:18.980
a putting of a critical and mutual

10:18.980 --> 10:23.600
benefit. Speaking in reply, Abdi Dacid Ali

10:23.600 --> 10:26.220
Shatambar expressed gratitude for the

10:26.220 --> 10:28.060
cause of the revolution. The powerful

10:28.060 --> 10:30.140
arrival of a goodwill mission from Somali

10:30.140 --> 10:32.540
is an important stage in the Republic's

10:32.540 --> 10:35.140
historical development. It not only shows

10:35.140 --> 10:37.220
the independence of our country, he added,

10:37.360 --> 10:40.500
but the independence of its policy. We

10:40.500 --> 10:42.580
hope that relations and cooperation will

10:42.580 --> 10:44.700
continue to develop in the future, said

10:44.700 --> 10:47.340
Somali Prime Minister El-Bassar. And

10:47.340 --> 10:49.260
that's the end of the news broadcast to

10:49.260 --> 10:49.940
you from Radio Moscow.

10:55.340 --> 10:59.300
Our commentary is now over. Here is what

10:59.300 --> 11:03.300
he writes. American newspapers have long

11:03.300 --> 11:05.520
been discussing the question of a meeting

11:05.520 --> 11:07.500
between President Kennedy and Premier

11:07.500 --> 11:11.060
Fouchal. All the while, the reaction has

11:11.060 --> 11:12.980
been favorable to the news that a meeting

11:12.980 --> 11:15.680
will take place. But some influential

11:15.680 --> 11:18.700
circles in America, circles that think in

11:18.700 --> 11:21.000
terms of a Cold War, have strong

11:21.000 --> 11:25.040
dissatisfaction. At first, Wolfpacker

11:25.040 --> 11:27.760
urged the President to highlight the idea

11:27.760 --> 11:30.560
altogether. together. Conquered by Kelly

11:30.560 --> 11:33.920
and Senator Kate Hart were two of the men

11:33.920 --> 11:37.140
who had gestured most previously. Then,

11:37.140 --> 11:38.740
after the announcement that the President

11:38.740 --> 11:41.000
and Mr. Khrushchev would be meeting in

11:41.000 --> 11:44.180
Vienna early in June, these circles began

11:44.180 --> 11:46.780
offering Mr. Kennedy advice on how to

11:46.780 --> 11:50.500
conduct himself. The history journals for

11:50.500 --> 11:53.240
one enjoined him to warn Premier

11:53.240 --> 11:55.700
Khrushchev not to negotiate the point.

11:56.940 --> 11:59.580
America, according to the Marchants of Big

11:59.580 --> 12:01.580
Business, should show the private union

12:01.580 --> 12:06.360
that it was strong and firm. Good advice

12:06.360 --> 12:08.540
is certainly surprising, to say the least.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.740
These councillors as much as urged

12:11.740 --> 12:14.700
President Kennedy to try to dictate to the

12:14.700 --> 12:16.520
private union some positions of strength,

12:16.780 --> 12:19.680
even their HEPA policy has been completely

12:19.680 --> 12:22.100
discredited itself, especially over the

12:22.100 --> 12:24.200
years of an Eisenhower-Dulles

12:24.200 --> 12:27.940
administration. More than once, this

12:27.940 --> 12:29.900
polity has brought the world to the brink

12:29.900 --> 12:33.220
of war. Remember the provocations against

12:33.220 --> 12:35.980
Syria, Iraq and troops landings in

12:35.980 --> 12:37.920
Lebanon, which were postponed by the

12:37.920 --> 12:41.400
Republic of Iraq, the gangster Utah flight

12:41.400 --> 12:44.260
deep into Soviet airspace, and the

12:44.260 --> 12:47.940
invasion of Cuba. In that one case, did

12:47.940 --> 12:50.040
the United States achieve its purpose by

12:50.040 --> 12:53.520
force? But the policies did cause it a lot

12:53.520 --> 12:56.380
of unpleasantness. The steam and oil

12:56.380 --> 13:01.060
cities set a new low. Last year, during

13:01.060 --> 13:03.120
the election campaign, leaders of the

13:03.120 --> 13:05.500
Democratic Party slayed the Republican

13:05.500 --> 13:08.600
administration for this policy. There was

13:08.600 --> 13:11.260
good cause for their criticism, and the

13:11.260 --> 13:13.940
attempts made since then to follow in the

13:13.940 --> 13:16.540
footsteps of the Eisenhower government in

13:16.540 --> 13:18.700
respect to China. And that, for example,

13:18.820 --> 13:21.420
has made it more than clear that any

13:21.420 --> 13:24.280
continuation of such a policy has an

13:24.280 --> 13:26.800
irreparable damage to America's proposed

13:26.800 --> 13:29.160
earnest positions in other countries.

13:30.460 --> 13:33.320
Neither has a situation the Trump policy

13:33.320 --> 13:36.020
benefited the United States, especially in

13:36.020 --> 13:37.560
its relations with the Soviet Union.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.920
The Soviet Union has always said that a

13:47.920 --> 13:49.940
position to change policy toward a

13:49.940 --> 13:52.900
socialist country is sure to fail. It

13:52.900 --> 13:56.300
always has and always will. The only

13:56.300 --> 13:59.340
realistic policy is peace of coexistence,

13:59.460 --> 14:01.720
a broad point of the dispute between the

14:01.720 --> 14:04.020
Soviet the Syrian early United States on a

14:04.020 --> 14:09.140
basis of equality and mutual respect. The

14:09.140 --> 14:11.340
late Franklin Bernhardt said, maintain,

14:11.800 --> 14:14.080
that good relations with the Soviet Union

14:14.080 --> 14:16.640
are the foundation on which more peaceful

14:16.640 --> 14:19.560
peace could be strengthened. Referring to

14:19.560 --> 14:21.440
the cooperation of the two countries

14:21.440 --> 14:24.100
during World War II, Mr. Roosevelt

14:24.100 --> 14:26.820
declared there would be no table peace

14:26.820 --> 14:30.480
unless these relations were preserved and

14:30.480 --> 14:33.960
built up in peace time. The arbitrary

14:33.960 --> 14:36.380
purpose that had united the two nations

14:36.380 --> 14:38.980
and the constitution of the war, he said,

14:39.160 --> 14:42.160
should be pre-transformed into close and

14:42.160 --> 14:45.040
lasting cooperation along with other like

14:45.040 --> 14:47.540
-minded countries in gaining a fair and

14:47.540 --> 14:51.220
lasting peace. If the spirit of Franklin

14:51.220 --> 14:54.520
Delano of policy is present at the Vienna

14:54.520 --> 14:58.060
meeting. We may expect some progress. We

14:58.060 --> 15:00.600
may expect a vindication of people's hope.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.560
That personal contact between a head of

15:03.560 --> 15:06.260
state of the world's two mightiest powers

15:06.260 --> 15:08.960
will improve historic American relations

15:08.960 --> 15:12.000
and better the international situation as

15:12.000 --> 15:15.320
a whole. You've been listening to a

15:15.320 --> 15:18.080
commentary by Leonid Vavilov. It came to

15:18.080 --> 15:18.780
you from the studios

15:26.860 --> 15:29.500
The various nationalities inhabiting the

15:29.500 --> 15:32.020
Soviet Union are described in the talk you

15:32.020 --> 15:36.600
hear now. There are more than 200,000,000

15:36.600 --> 15:40.220
,000 people living in the USSR. As for the

15:40.220 --> 15:42.460
Chinese People's Republic and immigrants,

15:42.740 --> 15:45.340
it has the 4 largest population in the

15:45.340 --> 15:47.780
world. The Soviet Union. As soon as the

15:47.780 --> 15:49.940
Constitutional Republic comprises the

15:49.940 --> 15:53.620
Soviet Union. Of the country's total

15:53.620 --> 15:55.940
population, Russians account for a little

15:55.940 --> 16:00.720
more than 114 million persons. Armenia 102

16:00.720 --> 16:04.080
million, about 40 million are Ukrainians,

16:04.180 --> 16:07.560
some 8 million are Belarusians, and 6

16:07.560 --> 16:11.140
million are U.S.A. Here we will have to

16:11.140 --> 16:13.580
start for a complaint matter. The

16:13.580 --> 16:15.580
difficulties of the years are which are

16:15.580 --> 16:16.460
the most important. take too much time.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.720
There are more than 100 different

16:19.720 --> 16:22.000
nationalities and peoples in our country.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.520
They are all different, both as to the way

16:25.520 --> 16:27.460
the people look and the native customs.

16:28.340 --> 16:30.380
Some of these peoples live in the foreign

16:30.380 --> 16:33.360
world. Others have never been found.

16:45.580 --> 16:46.260
I love you.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.040
Pfe Ð¿ÑÐ¸

Devenir

18:09.980 --> 18:11.620
More, more.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.960
Well, gentlemen, that's all for today.
